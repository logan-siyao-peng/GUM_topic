EDU	4. Discussion .
DiscussionTitle{<3}Content
EDU	We hypothesized
EDU	that the children ,
EDU	who were over the age of six at the time of collection ,
EDU	would have adult - like SI interpretations .
MainHypothesis{>5}Additions
EDU	We expected
EDU	that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity
EDU	over providing truth value judgments ,
EDU	and would result in adult - like interpretations .
TrainingSessionHypothesis{=6}FollowUpHypothesis
EDU	Further , we posited
EDU	that
EDU	if our initial hypothesis was not supported ,
EDU	and in fact there was some non-adult - like performance ,
IntroIfInitialHypothesisUnsupported{<7}Hypothesis
EDU	that there would be significant variability among the conditions ,
EDU	with cardinal numbers having the highest performance
EDU	and some the weakest .
Hypothesis{=4}Findings
EDU	On the surface , it does seem as if there is variability
EDU	and perhaps a larger sample size or more items could lead to a significant finding
EDU	( see limitations below ) ,
EDU	but at least for this study , the only significant finding was the difference between cardinal numbers and some .
EDU	Significant differences were not observed between all and cardinal numbers or all and some .
IntroDiscussion{=2}LimitationsAndFutureDirections
EDU	4.1. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS .
LimitationsAndFutureDirectionsTitle{<3}Content
EDU	This study is limited in its power and generalizability .
IntroLimitation{=5}Value
EDU	It serves as a reminder of the work
EDU	that needs to be completed for the cross-linguistic study of SI in particular and acquisition more generally .
EDU	Bantu languages are not included in studies of acquisition often enough
EDU	despite the numerous languages in this linguistic grouping and the millions of people
EDU	using them .
IntroLimitationAndValue{<4}FutureStudiesAndLimitations
EDU	Future studies need to include more participants and more items
EDU	to increase power .
EDU	Future studies should also include a larger age range of children
EDU	to document the age
EDU	at which adult - like performance emerges .
MoreParticipantsLargerRange{=7}RelatedStudiesAndMoreStimuli
EDU	Related cross-cultural studies have resulted in insufficient statistical power ,
EDU	but interesting trends
EDU	( e.g. , Nedwick , 2014 ) .
EDU	Follow-up studies with increased stimuli and participants are needed .
ImproveStudyPool{=6}TrainingsFactor
EDU	In a future study , it is also important to consider
EDU	if additional training in the difference
EDU	between reporting on felicity and truth value judgments
EDU	would impact results ,
TrainingDifferenceImpactReporting{=8}OrFavorRealObjects
EDU	or if more naturalistic experimental conditions
EDU	( e.g. , demonstrating actions
EDU	using real objects instead of two-dimensional depictions )
EDU	would be beneficial .
AdditionalTrainingDifference{>7}PreviousResearch
EDU	Previous studies in this region of sub-Saharan Africa have found evidence of cultural differences in testing behavior
EDU	( Hein , Reich , Marks , Thuma , & Grigorenko , 2016 ) .
FutureStudies{=5}CurrentStudyLimitations
EDU	The current study is too small
EDU	to make strong conclusions with regard to cultural differences and experimental methods ;
TooSmallLimitation{>7}Elaboration
EDU	however , in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found
EDU	that children responded more or less frequently
EDU	based on factors such as stimuli type .
PreviousStudy{<8}CurrentStudy
EDU	In the current study , the responses from two children were not included
EDU	because they responded the same way to every item through the training and all test items .
EDU	More specifically , they answered “ yes ”
EDU	that the puppet described the pictures well .
TwoChildrenNotCounted{>9}PossibleExplanationsAndSolution
EDU	It is possible that these two children understood the task
EDU	and really did believe
EDU	that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions ,
EDU	and in this regard , are not yet adult - like in their SI interpretations .
UnlikeAdultSI{>12}FirstTrainingItem
EDU	This is unlikely
EDU	as they said
EDU	that even the first training item was said well .
NotLikeAdultSI{=11}Politeness
EDU	It is also possible though that these two children were attempting to please the data collectors , or be polite ,
EDU	and that “ yes ” was in some ways a default answer
EDU	to be provided
EDU	when having to respond verbally in a test context .
PossibleExplanations{=10}PossibleSolution
EDU	Additional training with the methodology could improve outcomes .
Moretraining{>11}Puppets
EDU	The puppets
EDU	used
EDU	were picked specifically for this task with careful attention to their appearance .
EDU	Upon arrival at the school , however , it became clear that the children were not accustomed to playing with puppets
EDU	and that the data collection would be a novel experience for them .
CurrentStudyLimitations{=6}CardinalNumbers
EDU	Further exploration with greater cardinal number ranges could also prove interesting .
FutureExplorationCardinalNumbers{>7}Elaboration
EDU	Numbers through five in the participating communities are most often expressed with native Chitonga words
EDU	while numbers greater than five are typically indicated
EDU	using English borrowings .
NumbersChitongaWords{=8}ThisStudyCardinalNumbers
EDU	The cardinal numbers
EDU	included in this study
EDU	were only one through five
EDU	in order to avoid additional item variability ,
EDU	but larger numbers should be included in future research .
Discussion{=1}Conclusion
EDU	5. Conclusion .
ConclusionTitle{<2}Content
EDU	Albeit limited ,
LimitedFindings{<4}MainFindings
EDU	these results provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children
EDU	and demonstrate
EDU	that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order
EDU	identified in previous research ,
EDU	but appears to be completed at a later age in this language .
MainFindings{>3}SituateFindingsInExistingKnowledge
EDU	This interesting combination of findings
EDU	– expected hierarchy of difficulty , but differing age of acquisition –
EDU	is an important addition to our growing cross-linguistic knowledge of SI
EDU	and could be the result of language-specific differences in the use of SI lexical items or methodological differences .
