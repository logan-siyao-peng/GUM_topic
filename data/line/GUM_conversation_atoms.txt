26	so you are familiar with steam .
EachItemSimilarity{=5}HowThey'reDifferent
27	But now let 's try to figure out how they 're different ,
IntroHowThey'reDifferent{>6}Temperature
28	we 'll look at temperature , first .

89	Alright .
90	Well folks , now I 'm going to show you something else
91	that happens
92	when you change the temperature ,
