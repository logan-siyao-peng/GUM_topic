IntroductionHeader{<2}Content
EDU	The Chemical Wedding by Christian Rosencreutz is the way
EDU	I ’ve decided to present the title of this book .
IntroTitleBook{>5}HowBookIsOftenTitled
EDU	Most versions in English are called The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz ,
WhatBookOftenCalled{<6}MisleadingTitle
EDU	which suggests
EDU	( and most people
EDU	who ’ve heard of it suppose )
EDU	that the wedding is Christian ’s .
WhatIncorrectTitleSuggests{<7}WhoChristianReallyIs
EDU	It ’s not ;
EDU	Christian Rosencreutz is the purported author of a book called The Chemical Wedding .
ChristianRosencreutzRole{=4}RealAuthor
EDU	The actual author is Johann Valentin Andreae ,
EDU	whose name did n’t appear on the book originally ,
EDU	thus ensuring the confusion .
RealAuthorIsAndreae{>5}AuthorCallsItChemicalWedding
EDU	I ’ll call it herein
EDU	( as everyone mostly does )
EDU	simply The Chemical Wedding .
TitleBackground{>3}MoreInfoFromAuthor
EDU	Though its original readers would have had a certain amount of context for the truly bizarre and surprising events
EDU	it tells of ,
OriginalReadersHadContext{<5}Author'sSuggestion
EDU	it ’s possible that The Chemical Wedding is now more enjoyable
EDU	without knowing that context ,
EDU	and experiencing the book unmediated .
EDU	You might therefore wish to start right in on the first page of text
EDU	that follows
ReadWithoutContext{>6}ReturnToIntroLater
EDU	and only then return to this introduction .
Author'sSuggestion{>4}Comparison
EDU	Consider a similar case :
EDU	a little book
EDU	published in 1934 by the Surrealist artist Max Ernst
EDU	called Une Semaine de Bonté .
IntroFrenchBook{<5}BookDescription
EDU	It was made entirely of collaged illustrations
EDU	cut out of old books
Introduction{<1}Story
EDU	The First Day
FirstDayHeader{<3}Story
EDU	It was just before Easter Sunday , 1
EDU	and I was sitting at my table .
Setting{<5}PrayersAndReadyToCook
EDU	I ’d said my prayers ,
EDU	talking a long time as usual with my Maker
EDU	and thinking about some of the great mysteries
EDU	the Father of Lights had revealed to me .
Prayers{=6}ReadyToCook
EDU	Now I was ready to make and to bake
EDU	– only in my heart , actually –
EDU	a small , perfect unleavened wafer
EDU	to eat with my beloved Paschal Lamb .
SittingAtTable{<4}Disturbances
EDU	All of a sudden a terrible wind blew up , so strong
EDU	that I thought
EDU	the hill
EDU	my little house was built on
EDU	would be blown apart –
EDU	but I ’d seen the Devil do things as bad as this before
EDU	( the Devil had often tried to harm me ) ,
FeltStrongWind{>6}ContinuedMeditating
EDU	so I took heart
EDU	and went on meditating .
StrongWind{=5}FeltSomething
EDU	Till I felt somebody touch me on the back .
EDU	This frightened me
EDU	so that I did n’t dare turn .
EDU	I tried to stay as brave and calm
EDU	as a human being could under the circumstances .
FirstTugAndFrightened{<7}SecondTugDiscoverWoman
EDU	I felt
EDU	my coat tugged at ,
EDU	and tugged again ,
EDU	and at last I looked around .
EDU	A woman stood there , so bright and beautiful , in a sky - colored robe – a heavens covered with
StrangeTug{>6}AuthorFootnoteAndContinuation
EDU	1 Christian ’s story begins just before Easter , like Dante ’s Divine Comedy .
EDU	It can be seen as an allegory of Christ ’s death and resurrection ,
EDU	though this idea produces some puzzles .
Author'sNote{=7}CharacterIsContent
EDU	The birds sang so beautifully ,
EDU	the young deer skipped so happily ,
EDU	that it gladdened my old heart ,
EDU	and I could n't help singing too ...
DayOne{=2}DayFour
EDU	THE FOURTH DAY
FourthDayHeader{<3}Story
EDU	I was awake and lying in bed next morning ,
EDU	looking idly at the wonderful images and inscriptions all around my room ,
SettingNextMorning{<6}SuddenSoundFearOverslept
EDU	when suddenly I heard the sound of trumpets ,
EDU	as if a procession were already underway .
SuddenSound{=8}PageAndNarratorWakeUp
EDU	My page jumped out of bed
EDU	as if crazed ,
EDU	looking more dead than alive ,
PageJumpedUp{<9}PageAfraidPresentedToKing
EDU	and you can imagine
EDU	how I felt
EDU	when he cried ,
EDU	“ They 're already being presented to the king ! "
PageAndCharacterGetUp{=7}GetDressed
EDU	I could only groan in frustration and curse my lazy bones .
EDU	I got dressed ,
CharacterGotDressed{=8}PageRanOutToInvestigate
EDU	but my page was quicker
EDU	than I was
EDU	and ran out of the chamber
EDU	to see what was what .
SuddenlyAwakeNextMorning{=5}HadNotOverslept
EDU	He soon came back
EDU	and gave me the good news
EDU	that I actually had n’t overslept ;
EDU	all
EDU	I ’d done
EDU	was miss breakfast :
MissedBreakfast{=7}Didn'tWantToBotherHim
EDU	they had n’t wanted to wake an old man
EDU	who needed his rest .
FoundOutOnlyMissedBreakfast{>6}CharacterGetsReady
EDU	But now I had to get ready
EDU	to go with him to the lion fountain ,
EDU	where most of the others were gathered .
FearOverslept{=4}ReliefAndInscription
EDU	Such a relief !
EDU	My spirits recovered ,
EDU	and
Relief{<7}WentToGarden
EDU	as soon as I had got into my habit ,
EDU	I followed him to the garden
EDU	I have already told about .
ReliefAndGoToGarden{=6}ExamineMonuments
EDU	I found that the lion , in place of his sword , now held a rather large plaque .
EDU	Examining this ,
ExaminePlaques{<8}CanTellTakenFromMonuments
EDU	I could tell
EDU	that it had been taken from those ancient monuments
EDU	I ’d seen
EDU	and put here for some special reason .
ExaminePlaques{>7}SetDownInscription
EDU	The inscription on it was fading away ,
EDU	so I should set it down here
EDU	as it was then ,
EDU	and ask my readers to ponder it :
Garden{=5}Inscription
EDU	Prince Hermes :
EDU	Now after humankind has suffered so much harm here
EDU	I flow
EDU	having by god ’s counsel and with the help of art become a healing balm .
