7	The Chemical Wedding by Christian Rosencreutz is the way
8	I ’ve decided to present the title of this book .
IntroTitleBook{>5}HowBookIsOftenTitled
9	Most versions in English are called The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz ,
WhatBookOftenCalled{<6}MisleadingTitle
10	which suggests
11	( and most people
12	who ’ve heard of it suppose )
13	that the wedding is Christian ’s .
WhatIncorrectTitleSuggests{<7}WhoChristianReallyIs
14	It ’s not ;
15	Christian Rosencreutz is the purported author of a book called The Chemical Wedding .
ChristianRosencreutzRole{=4}RealAuthor
16	The actual author is Johann Valentin Andreae ,
17	whose name did n’t appear on the book originally ,
18	thus ensuring the confusion .
RealAuthorIsAndreae{>5}AuthorCallsItChemicalWedding
19	I ’ll call it herein
20	( as everyone mostly does )
21	simply The Chemical Wedding .
TitleBackground{>3}MoreInfoFromAuthor
22	Though its original readers would have had a certain amount of context for the truly bizarre and surprising events
23	it tells of ,
OriginalReadersHadContext{<5}Author'sSuggestion
24	it ’s possible that The Chemical Wedding is now more enjoyable
25	without knowing that context ,
26	and experiencing the book unmediated .
27	You might therefore wish to start right in on the first page of text
28	that follows
ReadWithoutContext{>6}ReturnToIntroLater
29	and only then return to this introduction .
Author'sSuggestion{>4}Comparison
30	Consider a similar case :
31	a little book
32	published in 1934 by the Surrealist artist Max Ernst
33	called Une Semaine de Bonté .
IntroFrenchBook{<5}BookDescription
34	It was made entirely of collaged illustrations
35	cut out of old books
Introduction{<1}Story
36	The First Day
FirstDayHeader{<3}Story
37	It was just before Easter Sunday , 1
38	and I was sitting at my table .
Setting{<5}PrayersAndReadyToCook
39	I ’d said my prayers ,
40	talking a long time as usual with my Maker
41	and thinking about some of the great mysteries
42	the Father of Lights had revealed to me .
Prayers{=6}ReadyToCook
43	Now I was ready to make and to bake
44	– only in my heart , actually –
45	a small , perfect unleavened wafer
46	to eat with my beloved Paschal Lamb .
SittingAtTable{<4}Disturbances
47	All of a sudden a terrible wind blew up , so strong
48	that I thought
49	the hill my little house was built on would be blown apart –
50	but I ’d seen the Devil do things as bad as this before
51	( the Devil had often tried to harm me ) ,
FeltStrongWind{>6}ContinuedMeditating
52	so I took heart
53	and went on meditating .
StrongWind{=5}FeltSomething
54	Till I felt somebody touch me on the back .
55	This frightened me
56	so that I did n’t dare turn .
57	I tried to stay as brave and calm
58	as a human being could under the circumstances .
FirstTugAndFrightened{<7}SecondTugDiscoverWoman
59	I felt
60	my coat tugged at ,
61	and tugged again ,
62	and at last I looked around .
63	A woman stood there , so bright and beautiful , in a sky-colored robe – a heavens covered with
StrangeTug{>6}AuthorFootnoteAndContinuation
64	1 Christian ’s story begins just before Easter , like Dante ’s Divine Comedy .
65	It can be seen as an allegory of Christ ’s death and resurrection ,
66	though this idea produces some puzzles .
Author'sNote{=7}CharacterIsContent
67	The birds sang so beautifully ,
68	the young deer skipped so happily ,
69	that it gladdened my old heart ,
70	and I could n't help singing too ...
DayOne{=2}DayFour
71	THE FOURTH DAY
FourthDayHeader{<3}Story
72	I was awake and lying in bed next morning ,
73	looking idly at the wonderful images and inscriptions all around my room ,
SettingNextMorning{<6}SuddenSoundFearOverslept
74	when suddenly I heard the sound of trumpets ,
75	as if a procession were already underway .
SuddenSound{=8}PageAndNarratorWakeUp
76	My page jumped out of bed
77	as if crazed ,
78	looking more dead than alive ,
PageJumpedUp{<9}PageAfraidPresentedToKing
79	and you can imagine
80	how I felt
81	when he cried ,
82	“ They 're already being presented to the king ! "
PageAndCharacterGetUp{=7}GetDressed
83	I could only groan in frustration and curse my lazy bones .
84	I got dressed ,
CharacterGotDressed{=8}PageRanOutToInvestigate
85	but my page was quicker
86	than I was
87	and ran out of the chamber
88	to see what was what .
SuddenlyAwakeNextMorning{=5}HadNotOverslept
89	He soon came back
90	and gave me the good news
91	that I actually had n’t overslept ;
92	all I ’d done was miss breakfast :
MissedBreakfast{=7}Didn'tWantToBotherHim
93	they had n’t wanted to wake an old man
94	who needed his rest .
FoundOutOnlyMissedBreakfast{>6}CharacterGetsReady
95	But now I had to get ready
96	to go with him to the lion fountain ,
97	where most of the others were gathered .
FearOverslept{=4}ReliefAndInscription
98	Such a relief !
99	My spirits recovered ,
100	and
Relief{<7}WentToGarden
101	as soon as I had got into my habit ,
102	I followed him to the garden
103	I have already told about .
ReliefAndGoToGarden{=6}ExamineMonuments
104	I found that the lion , in place of his sword , now held a rather large plaque .
105	Examining this ,
ExaminePlaques{<8}CanTellTakenFromMonuments
106	I could tell
107	that it had been taken from those ancient monuments
108	I ’d seen
109	and put here for some special reason .
ExaminePlaques{>7}SetDownInscription
110	The inscription on it was fading away ,
111	so I should set it down here
112	as it was then ,
113	and ask my readers to ponder it :

114	Prince Hermes :
115	Now after humankind has suffered so much harm here
116	I flow
117	having by god ’s counsel and with the help of art become a healing balm .
