EDU	Re(a)d Wedding :
EDU	A Comparative Discourse Analysis of Fan Responses to Game of Thrones
~
EDU	It is no exaggeration to say
EDU	that HBO ’s Game of Thrones is more than just a television series or a successful brand :
TVSeries{<4}TransmediaSystem
EDU	it is a transmedia system in the sense
EDU	first used by Marsha Kinder ( 1991 )
EDU	and popularized by Henry Jenkins ( 2006 ) ,
EDU	in which media-hopping networks of intertextualities extend the “ storyworld ” of an original production .
TransmediaSystem{=3}LargeFranchise
EDU	Now spanning six seasons and 60 episodes , with an average global viewership
EDU	( from its most recent season )
EDU	of 25.1 million viewers per episode
EDU	( Shepherd , 2016 ) ,
EDU	it has spawned five video games , a graphic novel adaptation , several companion books , two rap albums , a 28-city orchestral tour , a wide variety of tabletop games , toys , merchandise and mobile apps , and countless podcasts , fanfics and other fan-based creations .
GameOfThronesIntro{<2}FansAndThisStudy
EDU	Given the volume of content this represents ,
EDU	it is easy to forget that the television series itself is an adaptation of a book series with a pre-existing fandom .
EDU	As such , the Game of Thrones storyworld represents a remarkably rich and challenging environment for fans old and new ,
EDU	who must negotiate an increasingly complex network of paratexts and intertexts
EDU	in order to fully engage with its narratives .
OldAndNewFans{=4}CulturalConsumption
EDU	In this sense , fans of the series represent an emerging model for cultural consumption
EDU	that should be carefully explored .
ExploreCulturalConsumption{>5}MoreEmergingTransmediaSystems
EDU	Transmedia systems , like that
EDU	exemplified by Game of Thrones ,
EDU	are becoming increasingly prevalent
EDU	( e.g. , Star Wars , Harry Potter , The Walking Dead , the Marvel Cinematic Universe , etc ) ;
Examples{=6}PostdigitalSociety
EDU	these systems demonstrate , in microcosm , the global challenge
EDU	of managing the fire-hose flow of information in contemporary postdigital society .
Fans{=3}ThisStudy
EDU	The study
EDU	of how people , as fans , access and manage information within a transmedia system
ThisStudy{>4}ValuableInsight
EDU	provides valuable insight
EDU	that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars of the media industry ,
EDU	but to the wider context of cultural studies ,
EDU	by offering findings on this new model of the fan as consumer and information-user .
ValuableForScholarsAndPublic{=5}ValuableForAuthors
EDU	For us , as digital humanists , defining the “ transmedia fan ” is of particular relevance
EDU	as we seek to understand contemporary social and cultural transformations
EDU	engendered by digital technologies .
Introduction{=1}MethodologyAndConclusion
EDU	Methodology
MethodologyTitle{<3}Content
EDU	As a first step
EDU	in defining the “ transmedia fan ” ,
EDU	the current project undertakes a comparative discourse analysis of online conversations of Game of Thrones fans .
MainAnalysis{=5}SourceMaterial
EDU	One of the most dramatic plot developments in the source material
EDU	( Martin , 2000 )
EDU	was adapted to the screen in the penultimate episode of the third season , “ The Rains of Castamere ”
EDU	( Benioff & Weiss , 2013 ) .
RainsOfCastamere{>6}Elaboration
EDU	Readers of the book series had long anticipated and dreaded the events of the “ Red Wedding ” ,
EDU	while fans of the show unfamiliar with Martin ’s narrative were largely taken unawares by the pivotal episode .
FanDichotomy{>8}BackgroundExistingTwoReviewVersions
EDU	Since the television series ’ inception , writers at The AV Club have written two critical reviews for each episode :
EDU	one for viewers familiar with the books
EDU	( i.e. , “ Experts ” )
EDU	and one for viewers unfamiliar with the books and averse to “ spoilers ”
EDU	( i.e. , “ Newbies ” ) .
FanDichotomy{<7}TwoReviewsAndCommentThreads
EDU	What results are two completely separate reviews of “ The Rains of Castamere ”
EDU	which in turn document the fans ’ reactions to the episode in the form of user comment threads :
SeparateReviewsAndCommentThreads{>8}EachCommentThread
EDU	one comment thread
EDU	where fans were expected to be shocked by the outcome of the episode
EDU	and one comment thread
EDU	where fans had hotly anticipated it .
MainAnalysisAndSourceMaterial{=4}WhatTheStudyDid
EDU	As a pilot project , the current work takes the content of both comment threads
EDU	— a corpus of approximately 5,600 comments —
EDU	and analyzes each thread separately
EDU	using a qualitative coding method
EDU	aligned with constructivist grounded theory
Analysis{>6}Citation
EDU	( Charmaz , 2006 ) .
Corpus{=5}CategoriesAndComparison
EDU	Through this analysis , a categorization of themes emerges
EDU	illustrating tactics
EDU	for negotiating intertexts and paratexts unique to each group of fans .
CategorizationEmerges{>7}TwoCategories
EDU	These themes fall under two broad categories :
EDU	negotiation
EDU	( i.e. , emotional responses )
EDU	and tactical negotiation
EDU	( i.e. , cognitive , or reasoned responses ) .
Categories{=6}Comparison
EDU	A comparison of categories and sub-categories between both groups provides preliminary findings
EDU	to support an emergent model , or models , of the “ transmedia fan ” .
Methodology{=2}Conclusion
EDU	Conclusion
ConclusionTitle{<3}Content
EDU	The present research represents a first step
EDU	in exploring the impact of transmedia systems ,
EDU	as exemplified by Game of Thrones , through the study of fans .
PresentResearchFirstStep{=5}QuestionItPoses
EDU	The question
EDU	posed by this research
EDU	is , fundamentally , an examination
EDU	of how the problem of “ access ” is framed in postdigital society from the perspective of the consumer .
PresentResearch{=4}FutureResearchAndCurrentContribution
EDU	Future research should explore the negotiation tactics
EDU	observed in transmedia fans
EDU	using the principles of De Certeau ’s ( 1984 ) everyday life practice ,
EDU	in order to extend its application to the broader context of modern-day consumers .
FutureResearch{=5}CurrentStudyContribution
EDU	The current study will contribute to the development of further qualitative and quantitative research
EDU	that will more clearly define the information behaviors of the transmedia fan .
EDU	This project is of relevance to researchers in media studies , fan studies , information studies and digital humanities .
