EDU	Learning Objectives
EDU	By the end of this section , you will be able to :
EDU	Describe cognition
EDU	Distinguish concepts and prototypes
EDU	Explain the difference between natural and artificial concepts
~
EDU	Imagine all of your thoughts
EDU	as if they were physical entities ,
EDU	swirling rapidly inside your mind .
EDU	How is it possible that the brain is able to move from one thought to the next in an organized , orderly fashion ?
RhetoricalQuestion{<4}Brain'sActivity
EDU	The brain is endlessly perceiving ,
EDU	processing ,
EDU	planning ,
EDU	organizing ,
EDU	and remembering —
ExampleActivities{<7}BrainIsAlwaysActive
EDU	it is always active .
BrainAlwaysActive{<6}WeDon'tNoticeBrain'sActivity
EDU	Yet , you do n’t notice most of your brain ’s activity
EDU	as you move throughout your daily routine .
Brain'sActivity{>5}OneFacetOfCognition
EDU	This is only one facet of the complex processes
EDU	involved in cognition .
IntroScenarios{<3}IntroCognition
EDU	Simply put , cognition is thinking ,
EDU	and it encompasses the processes
EDU	associated with perception , knowledge , problem solving , judgment , language , and memory .
CognitionIsThinking{=4}ScientistsWhoStudyCognition
EDU	Scientists
EDU	who study cognition
IntroScientistsWhoStudyCognition{<6}WhatTheyStudy
EDU	are searching for ways
EDU	to understand how we integrate , organize , and utilize our conscious cognitive experiences
EDU	without being aware of all of the unconscious work
EDU	that our brains are doing

EDU	( for example , Kahneman , 2011 ) .
IntroCognition{=2}CognitivePsychology
EDU	Cognition
CognitionHeading{<3}CognitivePsychology
EDU	Upon waking each morning ,
EDU	you begin thinking
EDU	— contemplating the tasks
EDU	that you must complete that day .
ContemplateTasks{>6}ExampleContemplation
EDU	In what order should you run your errands ?
EDU	Should you go to the bank , the cleaners , or the grocery store first ?
ErrandsAndOrder{=7}FinishBeforeOrAfterClass
EDU	Can you get these things done
EDU	before you head to class
EDU	or will they need to wait
EDU	until school is done ?
Hypothetical{>5}ExamplesOfCognitionAtWork
EDU	These thoughts are one example of cognition at work .
Hypothetical{<4}CognitivePsychology
EDU	Exceptionally complex , cognition is an essential feature of human consciousness ,
EDU	yet not all aspects of cognition are consciously experienced .
CognitionNotAlwaysConsciouslyExperienced{<5}CognitivePsychology
EDU	Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology
EDU	dedicated to examining how people think .
EDU	It attempts to explain how and why we think the way
EDU	we do
EDU	by studying the interactions among human thinking , emotion , creativity , language , and problem solving , in addition to other cognitive processes .
WhatIsCognitivePsychology{=6}CognitivePsychologists
EDU	Cognitive psychologists strive to determine and measure different types of intelligence , why some people are better at problem solving than others , and how emotional intelligence affects success in the workplace , among countless other topics .
EDU	They also sometimes focus on how we organize thoughts and information
EDU	gathered from our environments
EDU	into meaningful categories of thought ,
EDU	which will be discussed later .
IntroCognition{=1}ConceptsAndPrototypes
EDU	Concepts and Prototypes
ConceptsAndPrototypesHeader{<2}Content
EDU	The human nervous system is capable
EDU	of handling endless streams of information .
InterpretInformation{<5}SensesReceiveStimuli
EDU	The senses serve as the interface between the mind and the external environment ,
EDU	receiving stimuli
EDU	and translating it into nervous impulses
EDU	that are transmitted to the brain .
ExternalStimuliAndSenses{<4}BrainFunctions
EDU	The brain then processes this information
EDU	and uses the relevant pieces
EDU	to create thoughts ,
EDU	which can then be expressed through language
EDU	or stored in memory for future use .
ProcessInfoStoreMemory{=6}IntroNotOnlyExternalInfo
EDU	To make this process more complex ,
EDU	the brain does not gather information from external environments only .
ProcessExternalInformation{=5}ProccesInternalInformation
EDU	When thoughts are formed ,
EDU	the brain also pulls information from emotions and memories
EDU	( Figure 7.2 ) .
EmotionsAndMemories{>7}FigureCaption
EDU	Emotion and memory are powerful influences on both our thoughts and behaviors .
EDU	Figure 7.2
EmotionsAndMemories{=6}SensationsAndInfo
EDU	Sensations and information are received by our brains ,
EDU	filtered through emotions and memories ,
EDU	and processed
EDU	to become thoughts .
NeurobiologicalContent{<3}ConceptsAndPrototypes
EDU	In order to organize this staggering amount of information ,
EDU	the brain has developed a file cabinet of sorts in the mind .
EDU	The different files
EDU	stored in the file cabinet
EDU	are called concepts .
FileCabinetAnalogy{<6}WhatAreConcepts
EDU	Concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information , images , ideas , or memories , such as life experiences .
EDU	Concepts are , in many ways , big ideas
EDU	that are generated
EDU	by observing details ,
EDU	and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive structures .
WhatAreConcepts{=7}UseConceptsAndFormThem
EDU	You use concepts
EDU	to see the relationships among the different elements of your experiences
EDU	and to keep the information in your mind organized and accessible .
HowWeUseConcepts{=8}InformedBySemanticMemory
EDU	Concepts are informed by our semantic memory
EDU	( you will learn more about semantic memory in a later chapter )
EDU	and are present in every aspect of our lives ;
Concepts{>5}ExamplesAndTypes
EDU	however , one of the easiest places
EDU	to notice concepts
EDU	is inside a classroom ,
EDU	where they are discussed explicitly .
IntroClassroom{<7}USHistoryExample
EDU	When you study United States history , for example ,
EDU	you learn about more than just individual events
EDU	that have happened in America ’s past .
MoreThanJustIndividualEvents{=9}Examples
EDU	You absorb a large quantity of information
EDU	by listening to and participating in discussions ,
EDU	examining maps ,
EDU	and reading first-hand accounts of people ’s lives .
USHistoryLearningMaterial{<8}HowBrainAnalyzesAndConceptualizes
EDU	Your brain analyzes these details
EDU	and develops an overall understanding of American history .
EDU	In the process , your brain gathers details
EDU	that inform and refine your understanding of related concepts like democracy , power , and freedom .
Examples{<6}ComplexOrConcreteConcepts
EDU	Concepts can be complex and abstract , like justice , or more concrete , like types of birds .
EDU	In psychology , for example , Piaget ’s stages of development are abstract concepts .
EDU	Some concepts , like tolerance , are agreed upon by many people ,
EDU	because they have been used in various ways over many years .
AbstractConcepts{=7}ConcreteConcepts
EDU	Other concepts , like the characteristics of your ideal friend or your family ’s birthday traditions , are personal and individualized .
EDU	In this way , concepts touch every aspect of our lives ,
EDU	from our many daily routines to the guiding principles behind the way
EDU	governments function .
Concepts{=4}Prototypes
EDU	Another technique
EDU	used by your brain
EDU	to organize information
EDU	is the identification of prototypes for the concepts
EDU	you have developed .
AnotherTechniqueToOrganizeInfo{<6}PrototypeDefinition
EDU	A prototype is the best example or representation of a concept .
PrototypeDefinition{>5}ExamplesAndTypes
EDU	For example , for the category of civil disobedience , your prototype could be Rosa Parks .
EDU	Her peaceful resistance to segregation on a city bus in Montgomery , Alabama , is a recognizable example of civil disobedience .
RosaParksExample{=7}GandhiExample
EDU	Or your prototype could be Mohandas Gandhi ,
EDU	sometimes called Mahatma Gandhi
EDU	( “ Mahatma ” is an honorific title )
EDU	( Figure 7.3 ) .
EDU	Figure 7.3
IntroGandhiAndFigure{<9}GandhiBackground
EDU	In 1930 , Mohandas Gandhi led a group in peaceful protest against a British tax on salt in India .
EDU	Mohandas Gandhi served as a nonviolent force for independence for India
EDU	while simultaneously demanding that Buddhist , Hindu , Muslim , and Christian leaders
EDU	— both Indian and British —
EDU	collaborate peacefully .
GandhiIntroAndDetails{<8}GandhiPrototypeMainPoint
EDU	Although he was not always successful
EDU	in preventing violence around him ,
EDU	his life provides a steadfast example of the civil disobedience prototype
EDU	( Constitutional Rights Foundation , 2013 ) .
Examples{<6}DirectExperienceOrArtificialTypes
EDU	Just as concepts can be abstract or concrete ,
EDU	we can make a distinction between concepts
EDU	that are functions of our direct experience with the world
EDU	and those
EDU	that are more artificial in nature .
