1	This year has once again confirmed the importance of the United Nations as the truly indispensable multilateral forum
2	for addressing today ’s global problems .
3	The humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa , ecological disasters such as Fukushima , political developments like the Arab Spring and terrorist attacks such as the assault on the United Nations building in Abuja last August require concerted action by the United Nations and its Member States .
