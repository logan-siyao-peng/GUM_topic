EDU	How do people look at and experience art ?
EDU	Which elements of specific artworks do they focus on ?
EDU	Do museum labels have an impact on how people look at artworks ?
QuestionsToConsider{<3}ViewingExperienceComplex
EDU	The viewing experience of art is a complex one ,
EDU	involving issues of perception , attention , memory , decision-making , affect , and emotion .
ViewingExperienceComplex{<4}RoomToInvestigate
EDU	Thus , the time
EDU	it takes
EDU	and the ways
EDU	of visually exploring an artwork
EDU	can inform about its relevance , interestingness , and even its aesthetic appeal .
IntroFocusOnArtExperience{<2}StudyDetails
EDU	This paper describes a collaborative pilot project
EDU	focusing on a unique collection of 17th Century Zurbarán paintings .
EDU	The Jacob cycle at Auckland Castle is the only UK example of a continental collection
EDU	preserved in situ in purpose-built surroundings .
ZurbaránCollectionBriefIntro{<4}OverviewAndStructure
EDU	While studies of the psychology of art have focused on individual works and distinctions between representative / non-representative topics ,
EDU	no work has been completed on the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of devotional themes .
NoSimilarWorkInPast{<5}PaperOverviewAndStructure
EDU	In this paper , we report upon the novel insights
EDU	eye-tracking techniques have provided
EDU	into the unconscious processes
EDU	of viewing the unique collection of Zurbarán artworks .
EDU	The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of different written interpretation on the visual exploration of artworks .
Overview{>6}Structure
EDU	We will discuss the potential implications of these techniques and our understanding of visual behaviours on museum and gallery practice .
EDU	The project brings together established research strengths in Spanish art history , experimental psychology , digital humanities , and museum studies
EDU	to explore ,
EDU	using eye-tracking techniques ,
EDU	aesthetic reactions to digital representations of the individual Zurbarán artworks as well as the significance of the collection as a whole .
ProjectOverviewAndStructure{=3}Eye-TrackingBackgroundAndArtData
EDU	Our experience of art develops from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes ;
EDU	the beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork .
ExperienceBeginsWithVisualProcesses{<5}Eye-TrackingResearchDetails
EDU	When regarding an artwork ,
EDU	a viewer gathers information through a series fixations ,
EDU	interspersed by rapid movements of the eye
EDU	called saccades .
IntroSaccades{=7}InfluencedByElements
EDU	The direction of saccades is determined by an interaction between the goals of the observer and the physical properties of the different elements of the scene
EDU	( e.g. colour , texture , brightness etc ) .
Saccades{<6}ValueInStudyingEyeMovements
EDU	Importantly , studying eye movements offers an insight
EDU	that does not depend on the participants ’ beliefs , memories or subjective impressions of the artwork .
NoBias{=7}PreviousResearchShowsPotential
EDU	Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential
EDU	to transform the ways
EDU	we understand visual processing in the arts
EDU	( see for example Brieber 2014 ; Binderman et al. , 2005 )
UnderstandingVisualProcessingArts{=8}SeveralFactorsMuseumVisit
EDU	and at the same time offers a direct way
EDU	of studying several important factors of a museum visit
EDU	( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich & Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) .
BackgroundOnEye-TrackingResearch{=4}ZurbaránCollectionDetails
EDU	Zurbarán ’s cycle of Jacob and his Sons has been on display in the Long Room at Auckland Castle for over 250 years .
EDU	It is the only cycle
EDU	to be preserved in purpose-built surroundings in the UK ,
EDU	and one of very few of its kind in the world .
CollectionIntro{=5}AreasUnexplored
EDU	It has a long history in scholarship
EDU	( Baron & Beresford 2014 ) ,
EDU	but many key aspects of its production and significance have not yet been fully understood .
Introduction{<1}DetailedSummaryOfStudy
EDU	In this study we used eye-tracking in the first stage

EDU	are a key part of ,

EDU	how aesthetic experience is evaluated
EDU	and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways .
