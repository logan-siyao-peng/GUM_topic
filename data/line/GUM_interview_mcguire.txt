EDU	Interview with LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire
EDU	Sunday , May 28 , 2006
EDU	The LibriVox website features a catalog of about a hundred completed books ,
EDU	including books in other languages like German , Hebrew , and Japanese .
~
EDU	Why did you decide to take the acoustic fate of public domain works into your own hands ,
EDU	and how did you go about it ?
Question{<3}Response
EDU	I think
EDU	that a vibrant public domain is very important to a healthy world ,
EDU	and so I thought :
EDU	here 's a way
EDU	to help the cause .
GeneralImportanceOfPublicDomain{<4}LaunchedLibriVox
EDU	I launched LibriVox ,
EDU	emailed some friends and some podcasters
EDU	who where doing literary stuff ,
EDU	and invited them to record a chapter of Joseph Conrad 's Secret Agent .
EDU	Things have grown steadily since .
LaunchedLibriVox{>5}Inspiration
EDU	By the way , AKMA was the first guy
EDU	I know of
EDU	to do something like this , with Lawrence Lessig 's Free Culture .
AKMAFirstPersonSimilarProject{=6}PartiallyInspiredProject
EDU	That ,
EDU	I think ,
EDU	started my thinking about this ,
EDU	but it took a while for the idea to crystallize .
HowTheIdeaCameAbout{=2}RecordingsAndLogistics
EDU	Hugh McGuire with some books
EDU	that have not yet been acoustically liberated .
EDU	Do you personally record audiobooks ,
EDU	and did you already do so before LibriVox ?
Question{<4}Response
EDU	LibriVox was my first experience
EDU	recording audiobooks .
EDU	I still do the odd chapter ,
EDU	but i am a bit delinquent
EDU	in finishing some of them these days !
McGuirePersonalRecordings{=3}RecordingQuality
EDU	Is there a particular LibriVox book
EDU	which
EDU	you think
EDU	stands out
NotableRecordings{=6}BasedOnMultipleReasons
EDU	because of the quality , the overall effort
EDU	involved ,

OtherGoodRecordings{>8}EdMarkFullIndex
EDU	Ed. :
EDU	See the LibriVox catalog for a full index .
NotablyGoodRecordings{=4}OptionToReRecord
EDU	Browsing the catalog ,
EDU	I find
EDU	that the quality of the spoken audio varies greatly from text to text or even from chapter to chapter .
VaryingQualityRecordings{=6}PossiblityOfReRecordChapter
EDU	If someone wanted to re-record a chapter
EDU	because they did n't like the speaker ,
EDU	would you then offer two versions ?
Question{<5}Response
EDU	Yes .
EDU	We take the Wikipedia approach :
EDU	if you think
EDU	it should be better ,
EDU	please help it be so .
UserAllowedToReRecord{>6}Variety
EDU	You 'll note
EDU	we offer a couple of versions of some books .
MultipleVersionsOffered{>7}PoetryProjectExample
EDU	Indeed our weekly poetry project celebrates this diversity of voice :
IntroPoetryProject{<8}PoetryProjectDetails
EDU	each week a new short poem is chosen
EDU	and as many readers
EDU	as wish to
EDU	record a version ,
EDU	so you get 20 + versions of the same poem , a very interesting audio experience .
LibriVoxIntroAndDetails{=1}LibriVoxPublicDomainLicense
EDU	Besides works
EDU	whose copyright has expired ,
ExcludingExpiredCopyright{<5}CreativeCommonsAndLicenses
EDU	there is an increasing number of modern books
EDU	available under Creative Commons and similar licenses .
EDU	You mentioned Larry Lessig 's Free Culture ,
EDU	but it also includes some out of print titles by publishers
EDU	who are open to the concept , such as O'Reilly .
QuestionContext{<4}Question
EDU	Do you want to limit the scope of LibriVox strictly to old public domain works ,
EDU	or do you have plans
EDU	to include recent works under reasonably permissive licenses as well ?
Question{<3}Response
EDU	We are only doing public domain works , for a number of reasons ,
EDU	partly to keep simplicity in our copyright situation --
EDU	public domain means it s as simple
EDU	as can be .
EDU	CC makes things more complex .
PublicDomainSimpler{=4}OtherSitesBetterForCC
EDU	Also , there are other sites , notably podiobooks.com ,
EDU	which are better suited to CC works than LibriVox .
EDU	we find
EDU	it makes things clear and easy to say :
EDU	published works , public domain , and leave it at that .
OtherSitesBetterForCC{>5}PodiobooksExample
EDU	As far as I can tell ,
EDU	podiobooks.com features " free as in beer " content â€”
EDU	material
EDU	which you can download ,
EDU	but which is n't under a free content license .
PublicDomain{=2}FreeContentName
EDU	Instead of " public domain " , would n't " free content " work just as well ,
EDU	using something like the Free Content Definition
EDU	to limit the scope ?
Question{<3}Response
EDU	This needs more discussion obviously :
EDU	we chose public domain
EDU	because the texts
EDU	we use
EDU	are public domain
TextsUsedArePublicDomain{=6}NoNeedExtraRestrictions
EDU	and we did n't want to add new restrictions , especially not non-commercial ,
EDU	since already our recordings are being used for a number of commercialish projects
EDU	( I ca n't recall any specific project names ,
EDU	but some pay-education sites use LV stuff ) .
EDU	That 's good and well and fine with us .
RecordingsAndTextsForPublic{=5}NoNeedGivePermission
EDU	We do n't want to have to give anyone permission
EDU	to use our recordings ,
EDU	we want anyone to use them for whatever they want .
WhyTheyChosePublicDomain{>4}BasedOnVolunteers
EDU	Also , for the thing to work
EDU	you need to have many dedicated volunteers
EDU	willing to do the management
EDU	( onerous )
EDU	and many willing to do the reading .
NeedDedicatedVolunteers{>5}VaryingPopularityAcrossBooks
EDU	While Pride and Prejudice will attract many readers ,
EDU	I do n't know about O'Reilly 's latest tome on XML ...
EDU	though I might be wrong .
