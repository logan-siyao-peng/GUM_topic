IntroductionTitle{<2}Content
EDU	Research on adult - learned second language
EDU	( L2 )
EDU	has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms
EDU	underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar
EDU	[ 1 ] – [ 11 ] .
ExistingResearchOnTopic{<5}SpecificStudiesConclusions
EDU	Of interest here , studies suggest
EDU	that ,
EDU	despite the difficulties
EDU	in acquiring L2 grammar ,
DespiteDifficulties{<6}ApproximateNative-LikeLevelsPossible
EDU	adult learners can approximate native - like levels of use and neurocognitive processing
EDU	[ 12 ] – [ 15 ] .
AdultSLABackground{<4}RetainingLevels
EDU	However , it is not enough to have attained such native - like levels .
EDU	Crucially , it is also desirable to retain them , even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2 .
NeedToRetainLevels{>6}CommonLongPeriodsNoExposure
EDU	In fact , substantial periods
EDU	( months to years )
EDU	of limited or no exposure
EDU	following L2 training
LongPeriods{=7}Common
EDU	are not uncommon ,
EDU	and may even be the norm
EDU	[ 16 ] .
PeriodsOfNoExposure{>5}ExampleScenarios
EDU	Such a scenario may be found in different situations ,
DifferentSituations{<6}ExampleScenarios
EDU	including when one studies a language in a classroom
EDU	and then stops taking classes

EDU	and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting
EDU	and then moves away
EDU	[ 19 ] .
Background{=3}PresentStudy
EDU	In the present study , we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar :
ExamineOutcomesNoExposure{=5}PossibleOutcomesListed
EDU	that is , whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / or less native - like neural processes
EDU	( “ use it
EDU	or lose it ”
EDU	[ 20 ] ) ,
DecreasedProficiency{=6}OtherPossibleOutcomes
EDU	no such changes ,
EDU	or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / or more native - like processing may be observed .
FirstPart{=4}SecondPart
EDU	Additionally , we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training , in particular between classroom - like and immersion - like contexts .
Introduction{=1}PreviousResearch
EDU	Previous Research
PreviousResearchTitle{<2}Content
EDU	We are aware of six studies
EDU	designed
EDU	to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure
EDU	following adult L2 training
EDU	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] ,
IntroSixStudies{>5}SomeRestrictions
EDU	all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral
EDU	( performance )
EDU	outcomes .
IntroSixStudies{>4}SideNote
EDU	( Note
EDU	that we do not consider case studies , purely observational data , or research on L2s
EDU	acquired by children ;
EDU	for a comprehensive review , see [ 16 ] ) .
IntroSixStudies{<3}Findings
EDU	The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills
EDU	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] ,
GeneralLanguageSkills{>7}MoreSpecificParadigms
EDU	though also on more specific paradigms
EDU	meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities
EDU	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ]
EDU	or lexical abilities
EDU	[ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
SkillsTested{=6}Comparison
EDU	These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects
EDU	who had not experienced a period of limited exposure
EDU	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] ,
EDU	or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects
EDU	[ 21 ] ,
ComparedWithNoExposure{=7}OneException
EDU	with only one longitudinal study
EDU	testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure
EDU	[ 24 ] .
SubjectsAndMeasurements{=5}PeriodsOfExposureContexts
EDU	Across the studies , the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training
EDU	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ]
EDU	or mixed classroom and immersion training
EDU	[ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
Training{>6}TrainingElaboration
EDU	The training lasted varying lengths of time , apparently usually in the range of a few years ,
EDU	and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels
EDU	( though not directly measured , except by [ 24 ] )
EDU	prior to the period of limited exposure .
StudiesMethodologies{=4}Studies'Findings
EDU	Overall , the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following .
IntroFindings{<5}Findings
EDU	A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition
EDU	( loss )
EDU	of L2 performance or knowledge
EDU	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .
GenerallyLessAttrition{>8}Details
EDU	Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month
EDU	[ 23 ]
EDU	or 6 month delay
EDU	[ 21 ] ,
Months{=10}Years
EDU	as well as after 2 years
EDU	[ 18 ] ,
EDU	though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years , and not earlier
EDU	[ 17 ] .
MonthsAndYears{=9}Plateau
EDU	Although attrition may take place within the first few years ,
EDU	some studies suggest
EDU	that it then appears to level off ,
EDU	with no further losses occurring
EDU	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
GenerallyAttrition{=7}LessAttritionAndNoChange
EDU	Higher levels of proficiency
EDU	( or exposure )
EDU	may be associated with less attrition
EDU	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ]
LessAttrition{=8}NoLoss
EDU	or even with no observed losses
EDU	[ 21 ] .
EDU	Moreover , one study found no changes at all in performance , across proficiency levels , after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure
EDU	[ 22 ] .
AttritionOrNoChange{=6}LanguageGain
EDU	Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed :
IntroGains{<7}Studies
EDU	after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training
EDU	[ 24 ] ,
EDU	and in another study after 2 years ,
EDU	though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension
EDU	[ 18 ] .
SomeStudiesLanguageGain{=8}UnclearExplanation
EDU	It remains unclear what might explain such gains ,
UnclearExplanation{>9}PossibleFactors
EDU	which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure
EDU	[ 24 ] ,
EDU	or to factors
EDU	related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training
EDU	[ 18 ] .
