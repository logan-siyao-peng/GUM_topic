Intro{<1}Do'sAndDon't's

EDU	Flirting Dos
Part1Do'sTitle{<3}Content
EDU	Start the conversation casually .
EDU	As in the real world , the first step
EDU	to flirting
EDU	is to get over your cold feet
EDU	and jump right in !
JumpIn{>6}WhatToSayAndAnxiety
EDU	Text the other person a brief message
EDU	asking them about their day ,
EDU	asking them a specific question about work or school ,
EDU	or simply saying " Hi ! " .
FirstMessages{>7}GetOverFear

EDU	so
EDU	if you 're having a hard time
EDU	taking the plunge
StrugglingToStart{<9}RememberLessStressful
EDU	, just remind yourself that no matter how badly it goes ,
EDU	it 'll be less stressful than an equivalent real-world encounter .
IMFlirtingLessStressful{>8}NoNeedToBeNervous
EDU	There 's no reason
EDU	to be nervous
EDU	when it comes to IM flirting —
NoNeedToBeNervous{<9}NoRealConsequences
EDU	if the person
EDU	you want to talk to
EDU	does n't want to talk to you ,
EDU	s/he always has the option
EDU	of simply not responding to your message ,
IgnoreMessage{=10}OrAwayFromComputer
EDU	as , from your point of view , this is indistinguishable from him or her simply being away from the computer .
GettingStarted{>5}ReasonForConversing
EDU	This being said ,
EDU	if you barely know someone ,
EDU	it can be a good idea to have an excuse
EDU	for starting a conversation
EDU	to avoid awkwardness .
HaveExcuseForConvo{>6}Examples
EDU	Asking for help with a work or school-related problem is almost always a good bet ,
EDU	as is asking a question about something striking about the person .
ExampleTopics{>7}DetailedBandExample
EDU	For instance ,
EDU	if the person has a band-related username
EDU	, you might say :
BandUsername{<8}HypotheticalMessage
EDU	" Hey , cool name .
EDU	Did you see those guys
EDU	when they last came to town ? "
GettingStarted{=4}ConvoContent
EDU	Start small talk .
EDU	After your initial greeting and exchange of pleasantries , you 'll probably want to ask how the person 's doing
EDU	( just like you might in the real world ) .
EDU	Ask him or her about work or school , his / her interests , or any recent trips , for instance .
SomeTopicsToDiscuss{>7}OrOfferComments
EDU	Rather than asking a question ,
EDU	you can also simply offer your comments on these things .
OfferComments{>8}VolleyBackAndForth
EDU	When s/he responds ,
EDU	add your own comments
EDU	or ask follow-up questions
EDU	and proceed from there !
SmallTalkFirstSteps{=6}NoPryingAndDon'tDwell
EDU	Do n't pry into his or her personal life —
EDU	keep things light , fun , and focused on worry-free subjects .
NoPrying{=7}Don'tDwell
EDU	Do n't dwell too long on small talk .
EDU	A minute or two is great
EDU	for breaking the ice ,
EDU	but much more can get boring fast .
Don'tDwell{>8}Example
EDU	For example ,
EDU	after we 've opened up
EDU	by asking about this person 's interest in the band in his / her username ,
EDU	it 's logical and reasonable to ask about this person 's musical likes and dislikes .
EDU	You can even offer your own opinions and suggestions .
MoveOnToNextTopic{>9}Example
EDU	For instance , you might say something like :
Example{<10}HypotheticalMessage
EDU	" If you like those guys ,
EDU	you might want to check out this band
EDU	called Manic Albatross -
EDU	they 're like the Beatles , only darker .
EDU	What sorts of other bands do you like ? "
SmallTalk{=5}Joke
EDU	Joke .
EDU	Everyone likes a good sense of humor .
IntroJoke{>8}MonroeQuote
EDU	In the immortal words of Marilyn Monroe ,
EDU	" If you can make a woman laugh ,
EDU	you can make her do anything "
EDU	( do n't worry , ladies —
EDU	the same is true for men ! )
EveryoneLikesHumor{<7}TryJoking
EDU	Try to be playful and even slightly sarcastic
EDU	as you respond to the statements of the person
EDU	you 're talking to .
TryJokes{>6}Examples
EDU	For instance ,
EDU	if you 're asked what you 're up to ,
EDU	rather than saying , " looking for people to hit on on Facebook "
EDU	you might find that it 's a better idea to give a sarcastic answer like " writing the great American novel " or " drowning my sorrows " .
SampleJokeToSay{<8}JokeLeadToMoreDiscussion
EDU	These responses have the added benefit of being natural launching points for conversations about your hobbies , like the writing
EDU	you 're doing on the side
EDU	and the great bourbon
EDU	you tasted the other day .
FirstExampleJoke{=7}MusicExampleJoke
EDU	In our example conversation , you might work a joke or two into your music-related small talk .
EDU	For instance , you might say something like ,
MusicExampleJoke{<8}HypotheticalMessage
EDU	" I do n't know
EDU	why every song on the radio nowadays has a Texas Flynn feature .
EDU	Does he even have time
EDU	to record
EDU	between rehab stints ? "
Do's{=2}Dont's
EDU	Part 2 of 2 :
EDU	Flirting Don'ts
Part2Don'tsHeader{<3}Content
EDU	Do n't be too self-deprecating .
EDU	Simply put , confidence is sexy .
EDU	This is more true for real-life situations
EDU	than it is online ,
EDU	but this mantra has some truth in the world of IM flirting as well .
ConfidenceIsMoreAttractive{<6}TooMuchSelf-DeprecatingCons
EDU	For instance , you 'll want to avoid making lots of jokes at your own expense .
EDU	Just one is plenty —
EDU	it should n't be a recurring theme throughout your conversation .
EDU	Doing this too often can quickly turn an otherwise flirtatious conversation into one
EDU	in which you appear needy and self-loathing .
NotTooSelf-Deprecating{>5}Don'tMakeFunOfOthers
EDU	On the other hand , this is n't to say that you should necessarily make jokes at other people 's expense ,
EDU	as this can make you seem mean and petty .
EDU	Any sort of pointed or caustic remarks about yourself or someone else do n't have a place in flirtatious conversations .
Don'tBeTooSelf-Deprecating{=4}Don'tBeTooSappy
EDU	Do n't be too sappy .
EDU	People like flirting to be fun .
EDU	For most people , receiving compliments is only fun up to a point —
EDU	getting more than one or two can make someone feel embarrassed and self-conscious .
TooManyComplimentsEmbarrassment{=6}QuestionMotives
EDU	It can also make him or her question your motives ,
EDU	leading the person to believe
EDU	that you may be trying to get something out of him or her .
QuestionMotives{>7}ComplimentsLessEffectiveOnText
EDU	Besides , the wooing power of flowery , gushing compliments is diminished
EDU	( to say the least )
EDU	when the compliments are displayed in a tiny box at the bottom of the screen alongside cartoon smiley faces .
Don'tBeTooSappy{=5}Alternatives
EDU	Instead of relying too heavily on compliments ,
EDU	instead , focus on having an engaging , genuine conversation .
FocusOnGenuineConvo{=6}ShowDon'tTell
EDU	Follow the mantra " show , do n't tell . "
EDU	In other words , show that you 're attracted to this person
EDU	by giving him or her a great conversation ,
EDU	not by stating it outright .
