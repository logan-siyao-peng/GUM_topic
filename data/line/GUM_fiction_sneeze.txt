EDU	THE END
Story{>1}MessageFromAuthor
EDU	Something a little lighter this week ,
EDU	I hope you enjoy it .
LighterStory{<3}Inspiration
EDU	Once it got started ,
EDU	I realised
EDU	that the idea must have been inspired by the title of Justine Larbalestier ’s How to Ditch Your Fairy ,
EDU	although it has nothing at all to do with that story at all .
LighterStoryAndInspiration{<2}ClosingRemarks
EDU	All in all , my story feels very light .
EDU	But I think
EDU	I needed something a little less dark ,
EDU	and there are some quite sombre tales coming up in the coming weeks .
EDU	See you then .
