EDU	becoming the 48th country

EDU	I 'm advised
EDU	that
EDU	as a result of our decisive response ,
EDU	the chance of an outbreak from our first case is low .
FirstConfirmedCaseNZ{>1}NZGeneralStepsCovid
EDU	Internationally , the situation with COVID-19 continues to develop at pace .
EDU	However , the Director-General of the World Health Organization said , this morning ,
EDU	containment â€¦ is feasible
EDU	and must remain the top priority for all countries .
WHOStatement{<3}NZApproach
EDU	This is exactly the approach
EDU	that New Zealand is taking ,
EDU	using three main tools :
EDU	border controls ; self-isolation ; and good public health practices ,
EDU	including highlighting the importance of basic hygiene .
ThreeMainStepsAndHygiene{>5}GovernmentEffortsControlSituation
EDU	At every step , the Government has taken decisions in the interests of health and safety of the wider public ,
EDU	and so far we have been among the best
EDU	at keeping COVID-19 at bay .
GeneralSteps{=4}TravelRestrictions
EDU	Just yesterday , Cabinet decided to extend for another week the travel restrictions
EDU	that have been in place for China since 3 February and for Iran since last Friday .
ExtendTravelRestrictions{>5}RestrictionsSuccessfulKeepCovidOut
EDU	These restrictions have played a key role
EDU	in keeping COVID-19 out of New Zealand for so long
EDU	and have given us time
EDU	to better understand the disease
EDU	and ramp up our preparations .
GeneralApproachAndTravelRestriction{=2}FurtherPrecaution
EDU	Of course , members will be aware
EDU	that there are outbreaks in other regions as well .
OutbreaksOtherRegions{<6}ItalyAndSouthKoreaQuarantine
EDU	So , as a further precaution , we have decided
EDU	that anyone arriving in New Zealand
EDU	who has been in northern Italy or South Korea
EDU	who has been there in the last 14 days
EDU	will be registered for self-isolation .
Self-IsolationFromItalyKorea{>5}Reasoning
EDU	This is based on an expert assessment of risk .
ExpertAssessmentOfRisk{<7}OutbreaksPossibleInDevelopedCountries
EDU	It recognises
EDU	that
EDU	while there are outbreaks in both countries ,
EDU	they also have well-developed health systems
EDU	and the outbreaks are largely located in specific regions .
ExpertAssessmentOfRisk{=6}Self-IsolationWorks
EDU	We know
EDU	self-isolation works .
EDU	It is a longstanding and successful approach
EDU	to managing infectious diseases
EDU	and has proven its worth again in recent weeks .
Self-Isolation{=4}HealthPresenceAtAirports
EDU	We have also stepped up the health presence at our airports .
IncreaseHealthPresenceAirports{>5}Regulations
EDU	All airlines flying into New Zealand have been requested to read a health message
EDU	upon landing ,
EDU	and all arrivals into New Zealand will receive health information cards alongside the standard customs declaration form .

EDU	As a result of decisions
EDU	taken on Friday ,
EDU	health staff are meeting all direct international flights
EDU	landing in New Zealand airports from Hong Kong , Japan , South Korea , Singapore , and Thailand .

EDU	Our border response is further ramping up
EDU	to have health staff available for all international flights into New Zealand .
