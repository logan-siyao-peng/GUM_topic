EDU	Andrew Westphal about Stardust @ home

EDU	Stardust is a NASA space capsule
EDU	that collected samples from comet 81P/Wild
EDU	( also known as " Wild 2 )
EDU	in deep space
EDU	and landed back on Earth on January 15 , 2006 .
WhatIsStardust{=3}StardustAtHomeProject
EDU	It was decided that a collaborative online review process would be used
EDU	to " discover " the microscopically small samples
EDU	the capsule collected .
CollaborativeReviewProcess{=4}HumanIntelligenceAndDirectorIntro
EDU	The project is called Stardust @ home .
EDU	Unlike distributed computing projects like SETI @ home , Stardust @ home relies entirely on human intelligence .
EDU	Andrew Westphal is the director of Stardust @ home .
IntroStardust{>2}WikinewsInterviewLogistics
EDU	Wikinews interviewed him for May 's Interview of the Month
EDU	( IOTM )
EDU	on May 18 , 2006 .
EDU	As always , the interview was conducted on IRC ,
EDU	with multiple people asking questions .
Intro{<1}Interview
EDU	Some may not know exactly
EDU	what Stardust or Stardust @ home is .
EDU	Can you explain more about it for us ?

QuestionAndPhotoCaption{<3}Response
EDU	Stardust is a NASA Discovery mission
EDU	that was launched in 1999 .
StardustDiscoveryMissionAndYear{=7}Purpose
EDU	It is really two missions in one .
EDU	The primary science goal of the mission was to collect a sample from a known primitive solar-system body , a comet
EDU	called Wild 2
Purpose{>8}Pronunciation
EDU	( pronounced " Vilt-two "
EDU	— the discoverer was German ,
EDU	I believe ) .
StardustDiscoveryMission{>6}RelativeImportanceContext
EDU	This is the first US " sample return " mission since Apollo , and the first ever from beyond the moon .
EDU	This gives a little context .
StardustDiscoveryMissionContext{=5}SampleReturnUnprecedentedVideo
EDU	By " sample return " of course I mean a mission
EDU	that brings back extraterrestrial material .
WhatIsSampleReturn{=7}FirstSampleReturnUnprecedence
EDU	I should have said above
EDU	that this is the first " solid " sample return mission —
EDU	Genesis brought back a sample from the Sun almost two years ago ,
EDU	but Stardust is also bringing back the first solid samples from the local interstellar medium —
EDU	basically this is a sample of the Galaxy .
RelativeContext{>8}Unprecedented
EDU	This is absolutely unprecedented ,
EDU	and we 're obviously incredibly excited .
SampleReturnUnprecedented{>6}Video
EDU	I should mention parenthetically
EDU	that there is a fantastic launch video
IntroLaunchVideo{<8}VideoDetails
EDU	— taken from the POV of the rocket on the JPL Stardust website —
EDU	highly recommended
EDU	— best I 've ever seen —
EDU	all the way from the launch pad , too .
EDU	Basically interplanetary trajectory .
VideoDetails{>9}GoodVideo
EDU	Absolutely great .
IntroVideo{>7}AvailableToPublic
EDU	Is the video available to the public ?
EDU	Yes
EDU	[ see below ] .
IntroStardustContext{=4}HowProjectCarriedOut
EDU	OK , I digress .
EDU	The first challenge
EDU	that we have
EDU	before can do any kind of analysis of these interstellar dust particles
EDU	is simply to find them .
ChallengeOfFindingParticles{>6}Reasons
EDU	This is a big challenge
EDU	because they are very small
EDU	( order of micron in size )
SmallSize{=7}UnspecificLocation
EDU	and are somewhere
EDU	( we do n't know where )
EDU	on a HUGE collector
EDU	— at least on the scale of the particle size —
EDU	about a tenth of a square meter .
Challenge{=5}HowProjectCarriedOut
EDU	So ...
EDU	We 're right now using an automated microscope
IntroUseAutomatedMicroscope{>8}AutomatedMicroscopeOrigin
EDU	that we developed several years ago for nuclear astrophysics work
EDU	to scan the collector in the Cosmic Dust Lab in Building 31 at Johnson Space Center .
WhyDevelopedTheMicroscope{>9}ARESGroupBackground
EDU	This is the ARES group
EDU	that handles returned samples
EDU	( Moon Rocks , Genesis chips , Meteorites , and Interplanetary Dust Particles
EDU	collected by U2 in the stratosphere ) .
AutomatedMicroscope{=7}Images
EDU	The microscope collects stacks of digital images of the aerogel collectors in the array .
EDU	These images are sent to us
EDU	— we compress them
EDU	and convert them into a format appropriate for Stardust @ home .
AutomatedMicroscope{=6}VolunteersAtHome
EDU	Stardust @ home is a highly distributed project
EDU	using a " Virtual Microscope "
EDU	that is written in html and javascript
EDU	and runs on most browsers
EDU	— no downloads are required .
VirtualMicroscopeDetails{=7}WhatVolunteersDo
EDU	Using the Virtual Microscope
EDU	volunteers can search over the collector for the tracks of the interstellar dust particles .

ImageCaption{<5}Question
EDU	How many samples do you anticipate
EDU	being found during the course of the project ?
ImageCaptionAndQuestion{<4}Response
EDU	Great question .
EDU	The short answer is that we do n't know .
ShortAnswer{<6}LongAnswer
EDU	The long answer is a bit more complicated .
EDU	Here 's what we know .
Complicated{<8}Context
EDU	The Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft carried dust detectors onboard
EDU	that Eberhard Gruen and his colleagues used
EDU	to first detect
EDU	and them measure the flux of interstellar dust particles
EDU	streaming into the solar system .
EarlierSpacecrafts{>9}WindOfInterstellarDust
EDU	( This is a kind of " wind " of interstellar dust ,
EDU	caused by the fact
EDU	that our solar system is moving with respect to the local interstellar medium . )
Context{<7}EstimatedAnswer
EDU	Markus Landgraf has estimated the number of interstellar dust particles
EDU	that should have been captured by Stardust during two periods of the " cruise " phase of the interplanetary orbit
EDU	in which the spacecraft was moving with this wind .
EDU	He estimated
EDU	that there should be around 45 particles ,
EstimatedAnswer{>8}Uncertain
EDU	but this number is very uncertain
EDU	— I would n't be surprised
EDU	if it is quite different from that .
EDU	That was the long answer !
AnswerQuestion{>5}UncertaintyOfOutcome
EDU	One thing
EDU	that I should say ...
EDU	is that like all research , the outcome of what we are doing is highly uncertain .
UncertaintyOfOutcome{>6}EinsteinQuote
EDU	There is a wonderful quote
EDU	attributed to Einstein —
IntroEinsteinQuote{<7}Quote
EDU	" If we knew
EDU	what we were doing ,
EDU	it would n't be called " research " ,
EDU	would it ? "
HowManySamples{=3}SampleSize
EDU	How big would the samples be ?
Question{<4}Response
EDU	We expect
EDU	that the particles will be of order a micron in size .
EDU	( A millionth of a meter . )
ParticleSize{<6}WhatPeopleSearchFor
EDU	When people are searching
EDU	using the virtual microscope ,
UsingVirtualMicroscope{<7}LookForTracksNotParticles
EDU	they will be looking not for the particles , but for the tracks
EDU	that the particles make ,
EDU	which are much larger
EDU	— several microns in diameter .
SampleSize{=5}NewSite
EDU	Just yesterday we switched over to a new site
EDU	which has a demo of the VM
EDU	( virtual microscope )
EDU	I invite you to check it out .
IntroNewSite{>7}SiteDetails
EDU	The tracks in the demo are from submicron carbonyl iron particles
EDU	that were shot into aerogel
EDU	using a particle accelerator
TracksShotInDemo{=8}ModifiedToSimulateDustImpacts
EDU	modified
EDU	to accelerate dust particles to very high speeds ,
EDU	to simulate the interstellar dust impacts
EDU	that we 're looking for .
NewSiteDescription{>6}AvailableOnMainWebsite
EDU	And that 's on the main Stardust @ home website
EDU	[ see below ] ?
EDU	Yes .
