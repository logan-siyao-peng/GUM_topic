EDU	Are there Moral Facts ?
~
EDU	So far , we have covered how evolutionary ethics relates to the question
EDU	what we ought to do
EDU	and why we are moral in the first place .
BriefRecapEarlier{<5}Metaethics
EDU	A related set of questions about ethics are metaethical questions ,
EDU	which concern the meaning of moral terms , our ways
EDU	of gaining knowledge of moral facts ,
EDU	and the nature of the moral facts .
MetaethicsDefinition{>6}Elaboration
EDU	In other words ,
EDU	apart from thinking about how we ought to live , and where our moral sense comes from ,
PreviousQuestions{<7}MetaethicalQuestions
EDU	we can also ask
EDU	what it means to affirm a particular answer to that question ,
EDU	how we could come to know the answer ,
EDU	and whether the answer would be a matter of fact or more like an opinion .
IntroMetaethics{=4}WaysToAnswer
EDU	Many books and articles in moral philosophy start with the observation
EDU	that moral judgments seem to be objectively true
EDU	and the assumption
EDU	that this is how non-philosophers also think about morality .
CommonWaysToAddressMetaethics{>5}MichaelSmithQuote
EDU	For example , Michael Smith writes :
IntroMichaelSmithQuote{<6}QuoteAndCitation
EDU	We seem to think
EDU	moral questions have correct answers ;
EDU	that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts ;
EDU	that moral facts are wholly determined by circumstances ;
EDU	and that ,
MoralQuestionsWithCorectAnswers{=8}AbilityToDiscoverObjectiveFacts
EDU	by engaging in moral conversation and argument ,
EDU	we can discover what these objective facts are .
Quote{>7}Citation
EDU	( Smith 1994 , 6 )
MetaethicalQuestions{=3}MoralJudgementsObjectivity
EDU	But
EDU	as we have seen above ,
EDU	evolutionary theory explains
EDU	why we would think
EDU	that moral judgments are objective .
EvoethicsAndMetaethics{=4}MorePhilosophers'Arguments
EDU	The philosopher Michael Ruse takes this
EDU	to show that the apparent objectivity of morality is something like an “ illusion ”
EDU	foisted on us by our genes
EDU	( Ruse [ 1986 ] 1998 , 253 ) .
RuseMainArgument{>7}Elaboration
EDU	Of course ,
EDU	even if Ruse is correct ,
EDU	this does not show that moral judgments are not objective ,
DoesNotShowUnobjective{<9}RaisesImportantQuestion
EDU	but it can make us think
EDU	whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained ,
EDU	as many philosophers assume .
QuestionNecessityObecjtivityOfMorality{<8}FurtherArgument
EDU	Ruse has also argued
EDU	that an evolutionary account of morality suggests
EDU	that there are no moral facts in the first place .
MainIdeaSecondArgument{>10}Elaboration
EDU	Anything
EDU	we want to explain about morality
EDU	can be explained
EDU	without mentioning moral facts ,
EDU	or so Ruse argues .
NoNeedMoralFacts{>11}ImplicationsForMoralRealists
EDU	If moral facts are explanatorily redundant ,
MoralFactsRedundant{<13}MoralRealists
EDU	indeed , moral realists
EDU	( those
EDU	who believe
EDU	there are mind-independent , objective facts about morality ,
EDU	as discussed in Chapter 1 )
MoralRealistsIntro{<12}ImplicationsForThem
EDU	need to say
EDU	why we should still suppose
EDU	that moral facts do exist .
FurtherArgument{>9}Sidenote
EDU	Interestingly , Ruse ’s methodological naturalism leads him to embrace a view
EDU	that goes against the metaphysical naturalist position
EDU	that moral facts exist .
MichaelRuse{=6}SharonStreet
EDU	Relatedly , Sharon Street , for example , argues
EDU	that evolutionary explanations of morality show
EDU	that moral realism is probably false .
MoralRealismFalse{>8}HerViewOfMoralRealism
EDU	The kind of moral realism
EDU	that Street has in mind
EDU	is the view
EDU	that moral properties exist as objective features of the world
HerViewOfMoralRealism{>9}Sidenote
EDU	( to wit , whether stealing is wrong is independent of
EDU	whether anyone thinks or feels
EDU	that stealing is wrong ) .
StreetArgument{>7}Details
EDU	Street starts with the premise
EDU	that our moral judgments are influenced by evolutionary forces .
IntroEvolutionaryForces{<10}ImplicationForMoralRealists
EDU	This fact ,
EDU	Street claims ,
StreetClaims{<11}DilemmaForMoralRealists
EDU	gives rise to a dilemma for moral realists
EDU	concerning the relation of the evolutionary forces
EDU	that influenced our moral judgments and the moral facts
EDU	claimed to exist by moral realists .
DilemmaForMoralRealists{<12}Implication
EDU	If there is no relation between the evolutionary forces and the moral facts ,
EDU	then it would be an astonishing coincidence
EDU	if many of our moral judgments were true .
Premise{=9}Implications
EDU	In light of the coincidence , we have no reason
EDU	to assume
EDU	that our moral judgments are true
EDU	— an unpalatable conclusion for realists .
Can'tAssumeMoralJudgementsTrue{>10}ClaimingRelationIsDubious
EDU	Claiming that there is a relation , however , is empirically dubious ,
EDU	according to Street .
PremiseAndImplications{<8}ConcludingPoints
EDU	Mirroring Ruse ’s claim ,
SimilarToRuse{<10}RejectMoralRealism
EDU	moral facts could be purged from what
EDU	we assume
EDU	to exist
EDU	because they do not perform an important explanatory function .
EDU	So , we should reject moral realism .
RejectMoralRealism{>9}EvoTheoryApplication
EDU	Street ’s argument illustrates how evolutionary theory can be used
EDU	to make a case
EDU	about which metaethical theories we should adopt .
Ruse'sAndStreet'sArguments{>5}SimilaritiesAndNextSecion
EDU	Both Ruse ’s and Street ’s arguments rely on the idea
EDU	that we should only accept that something exists
EDU	if it plays an indispensable explanatory role
EDU	and there are means
EDU	to resist these arguments .
FirstSimilarity{>8}Footnote
EDU	[ 12 ]
FirstSimilarity{=7}SecondSimilarity
EDU	Both arguments ,
EDU	as presented here ,
EDU	rely on the correctness of the evolutionary explanation of morality
EDU	they convey .
Similarities{>6}NextSection
EDU	In the next section , we turn to the relevance of evolutionary ethics for moral epistemology .
EDU	E.g. Enoch ( 2010 )
MetaethicalQuestionsMoralJudgementsObjectivity{=2}MoralJustificationAndKnowledge
EDU	Can We have Justified Moral Beliefs ?
SectionTitle{<3}MoralJustificationAndKnowledge
EDU	The evolutionary argument by Sharon Street can also be interpreted as an argument about moral justification and moral knowledge .
IntroNewTopic{<6}Content
EDU	Suppose
EDU	that moral realists assume
EDU	that there is no relation between our moral judgments and the moral facts .
Scenario{<8}Coincidence
EDU	It would seem like an incredible coincidence
EDU	if the realists were right
EDU	that our moral judgments are nonetheless true .
EDU	There are just too many possible moral truths and too many ways
EDU	in which evolution could have “ pushed ” our moral beliefs .
Scenario{<7}StreetExplanation
EDU	Street claims
EDU	that such a coincidence would be too much to believe .
TooMuchCoincidence{=9}CoincidentallyTrue
EDU	But what is the problem , exactly , with having beliefs
EDU	that are only coincidentally true ?
CoincidentallyTrue{<10}Example
EDU	Depending on how we understand “ coincidence , ”
EDU	my belief
EDU	that there is a bird outside my window
EDU	is coincidentally true
CoincidentallyTrueBird{=11}Circumstantial
EDU	because
EDU	had I looked a little later ,
EDU	the bird would have flown away already .
StreetExplanation{>8}AccidentallyTrueBeliefs
EDU	Accidentally true beliefs do not seem problematic in every case .
EDU	The question for proponents of Street ’s argument is to show why the evolutionary influence on human moral beliefs makes for a particularly problematic case of coincidence .
MoralJustificationAndKnowledge{=5}PhilosopherJoyceSensitivity
EDU	The philosopher Richard Joyce argues
EDU	that the problem has to do with the sensitivity of our moral beliefs to the moral facts
EDU	( Joyce 2006 ) .
IntroJoyceSensitivity{>6}Elaboration
EDU	Given that our moral beliefs are influenced by evolutionary forces ,
EDU	and not by the moral facts ,
EDU	our moral beliefs would be the same
EDU	even if the moral facts would change .
EvolutionaryForcesInfluenceMoralBeliefs{=7}InsensitiveBeliefs
EDU	But
EDU	because we should not hold on to such insensitive beliefs ,
EDU	evolutionary explanations of morality show
EDU	that our moral beliefs are unjustified
EDU	( because they are not sensitive ) .
MoralJustificationAndKnowledge{>4}LingeringQuestionsAndEpistemology
EDU	It is not clear , however , whether and why evolutionary explanations of morality reveal something about our moral beliefs
EDU	that is particularly troubling from an epistemological perspective .
UnansweredQuestions{<6}Epistemology
EDU	The impact of evolutionary ethics on epistemological questions depends on these deeper questions about epistemology .
EDU	[ 13 ]
EDU	Evolutionary explanations of morality , however , provide us with a useful starting point
EDU	for thinking about these questions .
Epistemology{>5}KlenkReference

Evoethics{>1}Conclusion
EDU	CONCLUSION
ConclusionTitle{<2}Conclusion
EDU	Evolutionary ethics has helped us to get a much clearer sense
EDU	of where the human moral sense is coming from .
EvoethicsContribution{<4}Elaboration
EDU	While this is a far cry from revealing to us what we ought to do ,
EDU	the research program seems full of promise nonetheless .
EDU	Once we get into the details ,
EDU	we can see that it also raises deep theoretical questions about evolutionary explanations , the relation of descriptive and normative claims , the epistemology of justification and truth , and the general viability of naturalism in ethics .
EvoethicsContributions{>3}StillMuchLeftToWonder
EDU	Much left to wonder , then ,
EDU	but with some ideas
EDU	about where to get our answers .
