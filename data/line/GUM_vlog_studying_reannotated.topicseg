64	I think
VansIssueIntro{>5}VansIssueDescription
65	it 's like this part on the left foot
66	because my foot feels super tight in only the left side ,
67	so something 's up

Library{=2}DSW

105	and I spent like 30 minutes in there

DSWStoryIntro{>4}DSWStoryDetails
107	And then she had to scan
108	and go get the shoes
109	and then she said
110	they did n't have the size .
111	So I ended up having to order them ,
DSWConflictOne{=5}DSWConflictTwoAndSolution
112	but she said
113	there was no way to do a direct exchange .
114	So she had to give me a return
115	and then re-ring it up .
DSWConflictTwo{<6}DSWStoryOverallAndSolution
116	And oh my gosh
117	I was literally in there for like 25 minutes
118	all to just do a simple exchange for the exact same shoe .
119	But it 's over now
120	and they 're gon na send them to me in the mail .
DSWStory{>3}DSWStoryResolution
