Intro{=1}ThreeMethods
EDU	Method 1 of 3 :
EDU	Starting Seeds
MethodOneSeedsTitle{<3}Steps
EDU	1 Choose the kind of basil
EDU	you wish to grow .
IntroStepOne{>5}Elaboration
EDU	Basil comes in many different varieties ,
EDU	each of which have a unique flavor and smell .
ManyVarietiesOfBasil{>7}ResearchAndChoose
EDU	Read up on different types of basil
EDU	and pick out one
EDU	- or several -
EDU	that appeal to you ,
IdentifyChosenBasil{=8}BuyThem
EDU	then order the seeds
EDU	or buy them at a garden store .
ChooseBasilVariety{>6}ExampleVarieties
EDU	Here are a few ideas :
EDU	Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice ,
EDU	and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers .
CinnamonBasil{=8}LemonAndPurpleBasils
EDU	Lemon basil actually contains citral , an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit ,

BasilsBasedOnScentTaste{=7}BasilsBasedOnPlantCycle
EDU	There are perennial basils
EDU	which come back year after year ,
EDU	like African Blue Basil
EDU	( which has pretty blue veins on its leaves )
EDU	and Thai Basil ,
PerennialBasils{=8}AnnualBasils
EDU	while most other varieties are annuals ,
EDU	which you 'll have to plant year after year .
EDU	Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow ,
EDU	but form pretty little bushes
EDU	which stay well - contained .
ChooseBasilPlant{=4}PlantingAndGrowing
EDU	2 Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost .
StepTwoTitle{>7}Description
EDU	Basil needs warm air and sun
EDU	to do well ,
EDU	so it 's often easiest to start the seeds indoors
EDU	instead of risking that they 'll get damaged by frost .
StartIndoorsAvoidDamage{>8}DependsOnClimate
EDU	If you live in a hot climate ,
EDU	you can start the seeds outside instead .
EDU	To figure out when the last frost will be ,
EDU	consult an almanac
EDU	or talk with other gardeners in your area .
StepTwoPlantIndoors{=6}StepThreePrepareSeedContainers
EDU	3 Prepare seed containers .
StepThreeTitle{<7}HowToPrepareSeedContainers
EDU	Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite , vermiculite , and peat .
EDU	Press the mixture slightly
EDU	to eliminate air pockets .
EDU	Dampen the mixture with water
EDU	so it 's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate .
PreparingToPlant{=5}PlantingAndGrowing
EDU	4 Plant the seeds .
StepFourTitle{<7}Description
EDU	Drop one to two seeds into each container .
EDU	Cover them lightly with soil .
EDU	Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap ,
EDU	so they stay moist .
HowToPlant{=8}DailyMaintenance
EDU	Leave the containers in a sunny window .
EDU	Twice daily , remove the plastic wrap
EDU	and sprinkle the containers with more water .
StepFourPlantSeeds{=6}StepFiveSprouts
EDU	5 Remove the plastic wrap
EDU	when the sprouts emerge .
StepFivetitle{>7}Description
EDU	When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil ,
EDU	it 's time
EDU	to remove the plastic wrap .
WhenToRemovePlasticWrap{=8}Maintenance
EDU	Keep watering the sprouts twice daily ,
EDU	never letting the soil dry out .
WaterDaily{=9}WhenToTransplant
EDU	When the plants become a few inches tall
EDU	and their leaves mature ,
EDU	it 's time
EDU	to transplant them to a larger container .
MethodOne{=2}MethodsTwoAndThree
EDU	Method 2 of 3 :
EDU	Caring for Basil
MethodTwoTitle{<4}Steps
EDU	1 Transplant the basil plants .
StepOneTitle{<6}Content
EDU	Once two sets of leaves have formed ,
EDU	basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers .
WhenMatureToTransplant{=8}WhereToTransplant
EDU	Basil does not tolerate frost
EDU	so do n't plant too early .
EDU	It 's best to put basil somewhere
EDU	where it will get a good deal of sunshine
EDU	and have well - drained soil .
WhenAndWhereToTransplant{=7}HowToTransplant
EDU	To plant the basil in the garden ,
EDU	dig holes
EDU	spaced at least 6 inches apart .
EDU	Place the roots in the holes
EDU	and place soil around the stems .
PlacingBasilInSoil{=9}EliminateAirPockets
EDU	Pat down soil around the plants
EDU	to eliminate air pockets .
HowToPlantInSoil{=8}HowToPlantInContainer
EDU	If you want to plant the basil in a container ,
EDU	make sure it 's large enough
EDU	to accommodate the number of plants
EDU	you 're growing ;
EDU	they need to be planted 6 inches apart ,
EDU	since they grow quite large .
StepOneTransplantingPlants{=5}StepTwoThreeWateringMaintenance
EDU	2 Keep the soil damp ,
EDU	but not soaked .
StepTwoTitle{>7}Elaboration
EDU	Basil does best in well - drained soil ,
EDU	and should not be subjected to standing water .
WaterButNotTooMuch{<8}HowOftenToWater
EDU	Water the mature basil plants once a day , in the morning ,
EDU	so the water has time
EDU	to soak in
EDU	and evaporate
EDU	rather than sitting on the plants overnight .
StepTwoWatering{=6}StepThreeMaintenance
EDU	3 Pinch off flower heads .
StepThreeTitle{>8}Elaboration
EDU	When you see flower buds ,
EDU	pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off .
PinchOffFlowerHeads{>9}Reasons
EDU	Flowers blooming create a hormone change
EDU	which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves ,
EDU	as well as reducing the amount of foliage
EDU	which grows .
EDU	This is called " bolting "
Bolting{>11}ConditionWhenItHappens
EDU	and is more likely to happen
EDU	when there 's extra sunshine .
HormoneChange{>10}Consequences
EDU	You 'll notice
EDU	that
EDU	if you leave the flowers ,
IfYouLeaveFlowers{<11}LankyAndBland
EDU	the plant will become lanky
EDU	and the leaves wo n't be as full or tasty .
RemoveFlowerHeads{=7}WatchForPestsAndMold
EDU	4 Watch for pests and mold .
StepFourTitle{<8}Elaboration
EDU	Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles
EDU	the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand .
Pests{=9}MoldAndWeeds
EDU	If your plants show signs of mold growth ,
EDU	they may not be getting adequate sunlight ,
EDU	or they may be too close together .
Mold{=10}Weeds
EDU	Weed out the smaller plants
EDU	to give the larger ones more space .
MethodTwo{=3}MethodThree
EDU	Method 3 of 3 :
EDU	Harvesting and Using Basil
MethodThreeTitle{<4}Steps
EDU	1 Harvest
EDU	and prune .
StepOneTitle{<6}WhenAndHowToHarvest
EDU	As the plant matures ,
EDU	pinch off the top two pairs of leaves
EDU	once a stalk reaches a reasonable height .
WhenToHarvest{=7}HowToHarvest
EDU	If you look closely ,
EDU	at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves
EDU	that will grow outwards
EDU	if the stem growing between them is cut off .
ObserveWhereToPinch{<9}HowToPinch
EDU	Cut close to those tiny leaves ,
EDU	but be sure not to damage them .
EDU	Pinching encourages the plant 's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves .
EDU	This helps the plants grow bushy .
HowToHarvest{>8}AvoidLowerPart
EDU	Do n't pinch on the lower part of the stem ,
EDU	or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy .
EDU	You want them to get bushy ,
EDU	so pinch from the top .
Harvesting{=5}UsingAndStoring
EDU	2 Enjoy the basil fresh .
StepTwoTitle{<7}Instructions
EDU	Rinse off the leaves
EDU	and use the basil
EDU	to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese .
StepTwoConsuming{<6}StepThreeAndFourStoring
EDU	3 Store the basil in the refrigerator .
StepThreeTitle{<8}Description
EDU	You 'll probably have more basil
EDU	than you could possibly eat fresh ,
EDU	so plan on storing some in the fridge .
StoreInFridge{<9}HowToStoreInFridge
EDU	Wash the leaves ,
EDU	dry them well ,
EDU	and wrap them in paper towels .
EDU	Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid .
StepThreeStoreInFridge{=7}StepFourFreezeBasil
EDU	4 Freeze the basil .
StepFourTitle{<8}Description
EDU	Freezing the leaves whole does n't work very well ,
EDU	but
EDU	if you puree it first
EDU	you can freeze it for months .
ShouldPureeFirst{>9}HowToPureeAndStore
EDU	Place the basil in a blender with a little water .
EDU	Puree it
EDU	until smooth ,
HowToPuree{>10}HowToStore
EDU	then put it in a food storage bag
EDU	and freeze
EDU	until you need it .
