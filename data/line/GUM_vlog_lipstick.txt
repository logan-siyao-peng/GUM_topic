AnastasiaBeverlyHills{=6}MoreSorting

NoExpirationDate{>9}Hypothesis
EDU	I do n't know
EDU	if this means
EDU	that they just do n't expire
Doesn'tExpire{=10}Unsure
EDU	or I do n't know .
EDU	I do n't know
EDU	what that means .
DoseOfColorNoExpiration{<8}SeparatePile
EDU	Okay .
EDU	Let 's keep going .
EDU	I 'm a just put all the Dose of Color in a separate pile

EDU	which is really really good .
EDU	That 's two years .
BlackUpLongShelfLife{=12}LongShelfLifeUnhealthy

IntroOldBlueLipstick{=12}PackagingAndDecision
EDU	Let 's see what the shelf life is .
EDU	That 's interesting .
EDU	The Urban Decay does not have a shelf life on the actual stick .
ShelfLifeNotOnStick{<14}Packaging
EDU	So you know
EDU	how lipsticks usually come in packaging ?
EDU	It usually comes in that little box ?
IntroBox{<16}ShelfLifeOnBox
EDU	I 'm thinking
EDU	that maybe Dose of Colors and Urban Decay have the shelf life
EDU	printed on those boxes
ShelfLifeOnBox{=15}WhoKeepsBox
EDU	but who keeps their lipsticks in a box ?
EDU	Like how do I know now
EDU	if this is expired or not ?
Packaging{=13}Decision
EDU	I 've definitely had this over two years though
EDU	so I 'm just gon na go ahead
EDU	and throw it in the expired pile .
EDU	I feel like two years is kind of the limit
EDU	that I 've seen so far .
BlueLipstickAndPackaging{=11}MoreSorting
EDU	This has a shelf life of six months !
EDU	Expired .
ExpiredLipstick{<12}Piles
EDU	So this is the throw out slash expired pile .

EDU	that I know
EDU	I 've had for at least over two years .
