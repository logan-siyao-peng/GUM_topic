LipstickContainer{<2}SpringCleaningPurpose

ShowShelfLifeSymbol{<5}Explanation
32	So you will find this on all your cosmetics , your makeup .
33	It is usually on there .
34	So
35	when it says eighteen M

Expired{=6}Deciding
70	Like — like usually with foundations
71	when it 's expired ,
72	you will see the oil separating and all that ,
ComparingWithFoundation{<7}FinalDecisionAndExpiredPile

106	Yeah that 's gon na have to go in the expired pile .
AnastasiaBeverlyHills{=6}MoreSorting
107	So Dose of Colors definitely does not have an expiration date on their products .
NoExpirationDate{>9}Hypothesis
108	I do n't know
109	if this means
110	that they just do n't expire
Doesn'tExpire{=10}Unsure
111	or I do n't know .
112	I do n't know
113	what that means .
DoseOfColorNoExpiration{<8}SeparatePile
114	Okay .
115	Let 's keep going .
116	I 'm a just put all the Dose of Color in a separate pile
117	cuz that 's kind of weird .
118	I might need to research that a little bit .
DoseOfColor{=7}MoreSorting
119	Oh !
120	Okay .
121	Let me show you guys .
122	That is an expired lipstick .

125	so one full year .
126	I know
127	I 've definitely had this over a year though .
FancyLipstickTime{<10}Decision
128	I think .
129	Have I had this over a year ?
130	My gosh it 's hard to think back .
131	But yeah this just does not look good .
132	That 's gon na have to go in the expired pile .
ExpiredFancyLipstick{=8}MoreSorting
133	Yikes !
134	This black is also not looking good .
IntroBlackLipstick{=10}Decision
135	I feel like I 've only had the black since last year Halloween though .
136	Or was it the Halloween before ?
Halloween{=12}HardToRemember
137	Guys this is harder
138	than I thought .
139	I ca n't remember
140	when I bought things .
HalloweenAndMemory{<11}DecisionExpired
141	It 's not looking good though .
142	It 's all like super separated .
143	I do n't like how that looks .
144	Expired !
BlackLipstick{=9}MoreSorting
145	Oh so this is interesting .
146	Black Up actually has twenty four months of shelf life for their lip pencils
147	which is really really good .
148	That 's two years .
BlackUpLongShelfLife{=12}LongShelfLifeUnhealthy
149	But is that actually good ?
150	Does that mean
151	that this is chocked full of preservatives ?
152	That 's like not healthy for you ?
153	I do n't know !
BlackUpLongShelfLife{=11}Decision
154	But I 've definitely had this for more than two years .
155	Expired .
BlackUp{=10}MoreSorting
156	This blue lipstick is definitely old .
157	Definitely old .
OldBlueLipstick{>13}ReiterateOld
158	I do n't know
159	if you can actually tell
160	by looking at it
161	but she 's old .
IntroOldBlueLipstick{=12}PackagingAndDecision
162	Let 's see what the shelf life is .
163	That 's interesting .
164	The Urban Decay does not have a shelf life on the actual stick .
ShelfLifeNotOnStick{<14}Packaging
165	So you know
166	how lipsticks usually come in packaging ?
167	It usually comes in that little box ?
IntroBox{<16}ShelfLifeOnBox
168	I 'm thinking
169	that maybe Dose of Colors and Urban Decay have the shelf life
170	printed on those boxes
ShelfLifeOnBox{=15}WhoKeepsBox
171	but who keeps their lipsticks in a box ?
172	Like how do I know now
173	if this is expired or not ?
Packaging{=13}Decision
174	I 've definitely had this over two years though
175	so I 'm just gon na go ahead
176	and throw it in the expired pile .
177	I feel like two years is kind of the limit
178	that I 've seen so far .
BlueLipstickAndPackaging{=11}MoreSorting
179	This has a shelf life of six months !
180	Expired .
ExpiredLipstick{<12}Piles
181	So this is the throw out slash expired pile .
ExpiredPile{=13}UncertaintyPile
182	This is the I do n't know what to do with it pile ,
183	but I think
184	these are all the Dose of Colors lipsticks
185	that I know
186	I 've had for at least over two years .
