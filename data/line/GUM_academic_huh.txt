EDU	Introduction
~
EDU	A fundamental tenet of linguistic science is that the sound of a word has a purely arbitrary connection to the word 's meaning
EDU	[ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
FirstTenent{>4}Example
EDU	Thus , the sound of the word dog in English is connected to the concept ‘ dog ’ by historical accident and not by any natural connection ;
EDU	roughly the same concept is just as well denoted in French by chien ,
EDU	in German by hund ,
EDU	and in Japanese by inu .
SoundArbitrary{=3}RestrictedPossibleSoundsPerLanguage
EDU	But it is not that a word can have just any vocal sound .
EDU	While the possibility space for sound systems of the world 's language is enormous ,
EDU	any given language makes use of only a restricted portion of the possible sounds
EDU	[ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
TwoTenets{=2}Conclusion
EDU	It follows from these two basic principles
EDU	– the ‘ arbitrariness of the sign ’ , and the ‘ selectiveness of particular sound systems ’ –
RestatePrinciples{<3}Conclusions
EDU	that the words
EDU	that exist in the world 's languages
EDU	should sound quite different from each other ,
LanguagesSoundDifferent{=4}LowLikelihoodUniversalWords
EDU	and that the likelihood
EDU	that there are universal words
EDU	is extremely small .
TwoBasicLinguisticPrinciples{<1}ThisStudy
EDU	But in this study we present a striking exception to this otherwise robust rule .
Exception{<4}HuhIsUniversal
EDU	From a systematic comparison of 10 spoken languages from 5 continents we find evidence
EDU	suggesting
Languages{<5}HuhIsUniversal
EDU	that a word like ‘ Huh ? ’
EDU	– used as a ‘ repair initiator ’
EDU	when , for example , one has not clearly heard
EDU	what someone just said
EDU	[ 5 ] , [ 6 ] –
HuhAndDefinitionRepairInitiator{=6}Universal
EDU	is a universal word .
IntroHuh{=3}ClaimsAndExplanation
EDU	There are two distinct claims
EDU	being made here :
EDU	1. that Huh ? is universal ,
EDU	and 2. that Huh ? is a word .
IntroClaims{>5}Elaboration
EDU	In support of the first claim ,
EDU	we show
EDU	that the similarities in form and function of an interjection with the specific function of repair initiation are very much greater across languages
EDU	than chance coincidence would admit .
NotCoincidence{=7}EqualVariation
EDU	In fact the variation in form in unrelated languages across the globe is about the same as the variation
EDU	we find in the way
EDU	any regular word
EDU	( e.g. , dog )
EDU	is pronounced across dialects of English .
FirstClaim{=6}SecondClaim
EDU	In support of the second claim ,
EDU	we show
EDU	that Huh ? meets the criteria of a word in the sense
EDU	of being a conventional lexical sign
EDU	which must be learnt .
HuhMustBeLearnt{>7}ContrastWithPriorLiterature
EDU	Thus , in contrast to what has been presumed for interjections in general
EDU	[ 7 ] , [ 8 ]
EDU	and for huh ? in particular
EDU	[ 9 ] , [ 10 ] ,
PriorLiterature{<8}NotAGrunt
EDU	we find
EDU	that this item is linguistic in nature
EDU	rather than being a mere grunt or non-lexical sound .
NotAGrunt{=9}HuhIsAWord
EDU	We show
EDU	that the form is locally calibrated in ways
EDU	that show
EDU	it fitting within different language systems .
LocallyCalibrated{<10}IsAWord
EDU	Huh ? may be a non-prototypical word ,
EDU	but it is a word .
Claims{=4}AddressWhyThisPhenomenonOccurs
EDU	Finally , we address the question
EDU	of why all languages should have such a word
EDU	and why its form should be so similar across languages .
WhyThisPhenomenonOccurs{<5}Explanation
EDU	We observe
EDU	that this item fulfils a crucial need
EDU	shared by all languages
FulfillsANeed{<7}Need
EDU	– the efficient signalling of problems
EDU	of hearing
EDU	and understanding –
FulfillNeed{=6}ConstrainedBySelectivePressures
EDU	and we propose
EDU	that its form is constrained by selective pressures in a conversational environment
EDU	that is essentially the same in all languages .
IntroHuhAndClaims{=2}ExamplesAndMethodology
EDU	Consider a case from English
EDU	[ 10 ] :
EDU	Extract 1 American English
EDU	[ NB , 1:1:19 ]
IntroExtract1{<5}Content
EDU	After speaker G makes a statement ,
EDU	speaker E utters the interjection huh ? .
EDU	This is followed by a repetition of the original statement by G .
ExtractDescription{=6}OpenOther-InitiatedRepair
EDU	The technical term for this type of sequence is “ open other-initiated repair ” :
IntroTerm{<8}Explanation
EDU	repair is initiated not by the speaker of the first turn
EDU	but by the other participant
EDU	( “ other-initiated ” ) ,
Other-Initiated{=9}Open
EDU	and the repair initiator signals
EDU	that there is a problem ,
EDU	but it leaves open what the problem is
EDU	( “ open ” )
EDU	[ 11 ] .
OpenOther-InitiatedRepairExplanation{=7}Response
EDU	The actual repair operation in response to this interjection is usually simply repetition , sometimes with slight modification .
Extract1{=4}Extracts2And3
EDU	Extracts 2 and 3 show structurally identical sequences in two other languages :
EDU	Siwu , a Kwa language
EDU	spoken in Ghana ,
EDU	and Lao , a Tai-Kadai language
EDU	spoken in Laos .

ExtractLabels{<6}Explanation
EDU	These examples show
EDU	that it is possible to identify the same conversational structure in unrelated languages .
SampleExtracts{=3}Methodology
EDU	Essentially , this method gives us a natural control over conversational data ,
EDU	making possible systematic comparison across languages
EDU	[ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
NaturalControl{>5}SimilarAcross
EDU	Sequences of other-initiated repair have been identified in every spoken language investigated so far
EDU	[ 14 ] , [ 15 ] ,
EDU	and
EDU	as the examples show ,
EDU	the interjection in the pivotal turn can be remarkably similar .
MethodAdvantage{<4}Methodology
EDU	This leads to the question
EDU	driving our study :
EDU	is huh ? in this context a universal word ?
Question{=6}PreviousLiterature
EDU	By compiling data from published literature
EDU	we found
EDU	that in thirty-one languages around the world , the interjection for other-initiated repair appears to be strongly similar
EDU	( Figure 1 ) .
EDU	However , written sources are rarely explicit about the precise form , meaning , and use of interjections .
QuestionAndPreviousLiterature{=5}Methodology
EDU	The most reliable way
EDU	to study a conversational interjection
EDU	is by examining cases of actual use .
ActualUse{=7}Details
EDU	Therefore we collected data from recordings of naturally occurring informal conversations in a sample of 10 languages from 5 continents ,
EDU	varying fundamentally in terms of phonology , word structure , and grammar
EDU	( languages 1–10 in Figure 1 ) .
LanguagesAndContinents{=8}Other-InitiatedRepair
EDU	For optimal comparability , we studied the exact same conversational environment across languages :
EDU	that of other-initiated repair
EDU	( OIR ) ,
SameEnvironmentAcross{=9}Other-InitiatedRepairExplanation
EDU	in which one participant produces a turn at talk ,
EDU	the other then signals some trouble with this turn ,
EDU	and finally the first produces a next turn
EDU	which aims to solve the trouble , usually by means of repetition and / or modification .
Methodology{>6}Excluded
EDU	In some languages the interjection , or an item similar to it , was also found in other sequential environments ,
EDU	for instance to mark surprise
EDU	or to pursue a response .
Purposes{=8}OfferInsight
EDU	Such alternative
EDU	( and probably derived )
EDU	uses provide insight in possible paths of semantic change ,
SimilarInterjections{=7}Excluded
EDU	but we exclude them here
EDU	to make sure
EDU	we are comparing like with like .
