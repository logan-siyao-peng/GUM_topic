EDU	2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory
EDU	By the end of this section , you will be able to :
EDU	State the postulates of Dalton ’s atomic theory
EDU	Use postulates of Dalton ’s atomic theory
EDU	to explain the laws of definite and multiple proportions
~
EDU	The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers , the scientists of their day .
IntroAncientGreekPhilosophers{<5}Theory
EDU	In the fifth century BC , Leucippus and Democritus argued
EDU	that all matter was composed of small , finite particles
EDU	that they called atomos ,
EDU	a term derived from the Greek word for “ indivisible . ”
AtomDefinitionAndEtymology{=6}AtomProperties
EDU	They thought of atoms as moving particles
EDU	that differed in shape and size ,
EDU	and which could join together .
AncientGreece{=4}Aristotle
EDU	Later , Aristotle and others came to the conclusion
EDU	that matter consisted of various combinations of the four “ elements ”
EDU	— fire , earth , air , and water —
EDU	and could be infinitely divided .
EarlyTheories{=3}NeverTestedIdeas
EDU	Interestingly , these philosophers thought about atoms and “ elements ” as philosophical concepts ,
EDU	but apparently never considered performing experiments
EDU	to test their ideas .
Background{<2}Dalton'sAtomicTheory
EDU	The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years ,
Pre-DaltonViews{<4}IntroDalton
EDU	until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis
EDU	that the behavior of matter could be explained
EDU	using an atomic theory .
EDU	First published in 1807 ,
EDU	many of Dalton ’s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory .
IntroDalton{<3}AtomicTheoryPostulatesAndElaboration
EDU	Here are the postulates of Dalton ’s atomic theory .
IntroListPostulates{<5}Postulates
EDU	1. Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles
EDU	called atoms .
EDU	An atom is the smallest unit of an element
EDU	that can participate in a chemical change .
Postulate1{=6}RestOfPostulates
EDU	2. An element consists of only one type of atom ,
EDU	which has a mass
EDU	that is characteristic of the element
EDU	and is the same for all atoms of that element
EDU	( Figure 2.2 ) .
SecondPostulate{>9}Elaboration
EDU	A macroscopic sample of an element contains an incredibly large number of atoms ,
EDU	all of which have identical chemical properties .

EDU	each of which has the same chemical properties .

Postulate2{=7}RestOfPostulates
EDU	3. Atoms of one element differ in properties from atoms of all other elements .
Postulate3{=8}RestOfPostulates
EDU	4. A compound consists of atoms of two or more elements
EDU	combined in a small , whole-number ratio .
EDU	In a given compound , the numbers of atoms of each of its elements are always present in the same ratio
EDU	( Figure 2.3 ) .

Postulate4{=9}Postulate5
EDU	5. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change ,
EDU	but are instead rearranged to yield substances
EDU	that are different from those
EDU	present before the change
EDU	( Figure 2.4 ) .

AtomicTheoryPostulates{=4}ConnectionToMacroscopicProperties
EDU	Dalton ’s atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter
EDU	that you ’ve learned about .
ConnectionToMacroscopicProperties{>5}Examples
EDU	For example ,
EDU	if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom ,
EDU	then it can not be broken down into simpler substances ,
EDU	that is , into substances
EDU	composed of fewer types of atoms .
CannotBeBrokenDownFurther{=6}ConservationOfMatter
EDU	And
EDU	if atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change ,
EDU	then the total mass of matter present
EDU	when matter changes from one type to another
EDU	will remain constant

EDU	( the law of conservation of matter ) .

EDU	Solution
SolutionTitle{<6}SolutionContent
EDU	The starting materials consist of two green spheres and two purple spheres .
EDU	The products consist of only one green sphere and one purple sphere .
Scenario{<7}AppliedToDalton'sPostulates
EDU	This violates Dalton ’s postulate
EDU	that atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change ,
EDU	but are merely redistributed .
EDU	( In this case , atoms appear to have been destroyed . )
