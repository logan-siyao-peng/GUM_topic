EDU	Hi everyone !
EDU	So I 'm just about to tuck into a crisp sandwich .
EDU	Salt vinegar squares are my crisp of choice .
EDU	And I 've got some apple juice
EDU	because this signifies kind of my diet staples the last few weeks .
Diet{<2}AnnouncesPregnancy
EDU	So I thought
EDU	this was an opportune time
EDU	to tell you all
EDU	that a couple of weeks ago I found out
EDU	that I am pregnant .
IntroPregnant{>1}ReactionsAnxietyAndExperience
EDU	It 's the first week
EDU	that I 've been actually able to say the words " I 'm pregnant "
EDU	and have it not feel really weird .
NoLongerFeelWeird{<6}DateFoundOut
EDU	I found out on ,
EDU	I think
EDU	it was the 3rd of January .
MistakenDate{<7}DateFoundOut
EDU	Let 's just double check that .
EDU	No , excuse me ,
EDU	it was the fifth of January .
WhenSheFoundOut{=5}HowSheFoundOut
EDU	I found out on the fifth
EDU	and that was
EDU	because my period was late
EDU	and I am never late .
LatePeriod{>6}Tracking
EDU	As soon as I came off the pill
EDU	my period came back pretty regularly
CameOffPill{<7}StartToTrack
EDU	and I started tracking my periods
EDU	just because I knew
EDU	the pregnancy was something
EDU	that eventually we would want ,
WantedToBePregnant{>8}UsefulToTrackCycle
EDU	and I know
EDU	that it helps if you 've been tracking your period
EDU	so you know your cycle .
FirstFindingOut{<4}InitialReactions
EDU	And for the first few days / couple of weeks I felt really anxious , really scared , really worried ,
AnxietyAndWorry{>6}Elaboration
EDU	because my initial reaction was ,
EDU	and still now , I 'm a bit like ,
EDU	I 'm not old enough for this .
EDU	I 'm not grown up enough
EDU	to do this .
NotFeelingGrownUpEnough{>7}AdultAndChild
EDU	You feel like you 're prepared ,
FeelPrepared{=10}LongRelationshipAndAdult
EDU	you 're in a ,
EDU	you know ,
EDU	in a relationship .
EDU	We have been for years ,
EDU	we 're adults ,
Adult{>9}Unsure
EDU	but I do n't know what it is .
Adult{=8}FeelingLikeChild
EDU	As soon as I found out
EDU	I just went back to like a 14 year old girl .
EDU	I 'm like
EDU	" oh my god , what am I gon na tell my mom ?
EDU	I ca n't be a mom . "
FeltLikeChild{=9}AnxiousAndOverwhelmed
EDU	So really I was just very very overwhelmed and anxious
EDU	so it took a few days for me to really process what happened .
AnxietyAndWorry{=5}Shock
EDU	It was quite a shock
EDU	and it 's such a huge huge thing .
EDU	It 's life-changing ,
Life-ChangingShock{>6}ScaredAndTalkingToPeople
EDU	and so for the first couple of weeks that 's all
EDU	I could focus on ,
EDU	was how life-changing it was
EDU	and it was really scary .
Scary{=7}TalkToPeople
EDU	I then started to talk to people about it ,
EDU	that made me feel better .
InitialReactions{=3}Vlogging
EDU	And , I 'm not really sure what I 'm trying to say .
EDU	I do n't want this to be too , like , all over the place
EDU	but I decided
EDU	I do want to document this some way ,
EDU	whether I –
DecisionToDocument{<5}WhyDocument
EDU	At first I was like ,
EDU	I do n't need to copy it on YouTube
EDU	but I definitely wanted to document this in some kind of video form ,
EDU	just because it 's such a huge thing .
EDU	You ’re only pregnant for the first time once .
VlogBecauseImportantEvent{=4}WhatToVlogAndWhy
EDU	But I did want to document my first trimester to an extent ,
EDU	because
EDU	when I first found out ,
EDU	I did start to watch videos of people 's first few weeks ,
WatchedVideos{=7}FrightenedFromPeople'sExcitement
EDU	but again ,
EDU	maybe because I was n't in a great headspace ,
EDU	that just frightened me ,
EDU	which again was because everyone was just saying how awful they felt , how excited they were ,
WatchingOtherVlogs{=6}WorryFromWatching
EDU	and I did n't feel excited .
EDU	I felt worried .
VideosFeelingWorried{<8}Reasons
EDU	The thought
EDU	of telling , like , my mom .
EDU	I cried
EDU	when I told her
EDU	because I felt so , just , like , oh my god .
CriedTellingMom{<9}GuiltForNotBeingHappy
EDU	I mean
EDU	you , you feel quite bad
EDU	when you feel like that ,
EDU	because it 's such a happy thing
CryingTellingMom{=7}CurrentAcceptanceAndGuiltyFeelings
EDU	and now ,
EDU	you know ,
EDU	I –
EDU	you know ,
EDU	I know
NowRestarts{<9}CurrentAcceptance
EDU	I 've kind of accepted .
EDU	The shock has kind of sunk in .
EDU	And I am happy to tell people ,
CurrentAcceptance{<8}GuiltyFeelingsBefore
EDU	but at first
EDU	when you 're trying to get your head around it ,
EDU	it 's very daunting
Daunting{<9}GuiltyForFeelingBad
EDU	and you just feel awful
EDU	thinking .
EDU	The thought
EDU	of telling someone
EDU	makes me want to burst into tears .
GuiltyFeelings{=10}ManyFeelings
EDU	All these things going onto my head .
WatchingOtherVlogsAndExperience{=5}WhatToVlogNow
EDU	So that also then helped me to make the decision
EDU	that I do want to document this ,
HelpedDecision{<6}HowToDocumentNow
EDU	but I 'm probably going to do it , like , with hindsight ,
EDU	so I check in every now and again
EDU	and just let you know how I 've been feeling .
OccasionalCheckIns{=7}NotDocumentingSickAndWaiting
EDU	But in terms
EDU	of if I am sick
EDU	or I 'm not feeling great ,
EDU	I 'm not gon na vlog
EDU	whilst I feel like that .
Won'tVlogWhenSick{>9}Reasons
EDU	I would n't want to vlog
EDU	whilst I feel like that
EDU	if I was just ill anyway .
Wouldn'tWantToVlog{=10}Doesn'tWantToShowSick
EDU	And I just think
EDU	it did n't help me seeing people at their worst at the very beginning ,
EDU	because all you hear is doom and gloom .
NotDocumentingSick{=8}WaitingAFewWeeks
EDU	I decided to wait a few weeks
EDU	before I even started to talk about it ,
EDU	so I think
EDU	I 'm about seven weeks .
InitialReactionsAndVlogging{=2}FirstFewWeeksExperience
EDU	I am waiting for my first midwife appointment .
FirstAppointment{<4}BookingProcess
EDU	I went –
EDU	I booked the doctors ,
EDU	because the NHS says
EDU	you need to book a doctor 's appointment ,
NHSRecommendation{=6}WasteOfTime
EDU	but that was a waste of time
EDU	and I felt quite bad
EDU	about taking that appointment .
EDU	Because in my area you 'd have to self-refer ,
EDU	so I have n't had any kind of appointment or checkups or anything
BookingDoctor'sAppointment{<5}Tracking
EDU	but I have been tracking
EDU	– tracking –
EDU	I 've got an app
EDU	called " what to expect " ,
App{>6}AppDetails
EDU	put in my ,
EDU	you know ,
EDU	cycle situation
EDU	and have an estimated due date ,
EDU	which is about mid-September .
Appointments{=3}Symptoms
EDU	In terms of symptoms ,
EDU	I mean
EDU	I have n't felt the best ,
EDU	but I have been able to get through it .
ManageableSymptoms{>5}NotSick
EDU	I 've definitely struggled on some days
EDU	but I have n't been sick .
OverallState{<4}AppetiteSymptoms
EDU	The biggest thing for me is I have lost –
EDU	I dipped ,
EDU	and I have lost my appetite .
EDU	There 's nothing
EDU	I really feel like eating .
LossInAppetite{>6}Details
EDU	I do n't have particular aversions to things ,
EDU	I do n't feel really sick
EDU	when I smell anything at the moment .
NoParticularAversions{>9}NotInMoodFor
EDU	But there 's things
EDU	that I do n't want to have ,
EDU	so like coffee ,
EDU	I just know
EDU	that I do n't want that ,
Aversions{=8}Cravings
EDU	and all I want is beige :
BeigeFoods{>10}Details
EDU	I want chips ,
EDU	I want white toast ,
EDU	it 's pretty much all
EDU	I eat all day .
ChipsAndToast{=11}Pasta
EDU	Pasta
EDU	if I want something hot maybe ,
EDU	I 've had soup ,
EDU	but essentially starchy carbs
CravingCarbs{=9}Justification
EDU	and that 's quite normal
EDU	it seems .
EDU	Like , everyone craves that at this point
Normal{=10}NeedEnergy
EDU	because you 're ,
EDU	you know ,
EDU	building a baby ,
EDU	so you need that energy .
CravingsAndAversions{=7}TriesToEatHealthy
EDU	So I do n't feel particularly great nutrition-wise ,
EDU	and I 'm trying to eat fruit
EDU	where I can
EDU	and veg
EDU	when I can ,
TryToEatHealthy{=8}GoWithFlow
EDU	but I 'm just sort of going with it ,
EDU	because I know
EDU	there 's enough information out there
EDU	that this is generally how it goes .
EDU	And then hopefully you start to feel a bit better .
AppetiteSymptoms{=5}PhysicalSymptoms
EDU	I have felt nauseous and
EDU	as everyone describes it ,
EDU	a bit jet-lagged , a bit cloudy in my head ,
Nausea{=6}Headaches
EDU	and the worst thing for me has been headaches .
EDU	I have n't had them this week ,
EDU	but last week I had a couple of really really bad ones
EDU	and I have n't had headaches that bad for years .
