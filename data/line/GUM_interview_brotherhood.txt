EDU	not to sell it to me ,
EDU	but instead sold me two books
MagicStore{=6}InfluencesBooksAndMagicians
EDU	which I still own today -
EDU	" Scarne on Card Tricks " and " Scarne on Magic Tricks " .
EDU	That started me out on books
EDU	and I have amassed quite a few since then .

EDU	Has the internet helped or hurt magic ?
Question{<5}Response
EDU	Both .
EDU	I think

InternetIncreaseMagicPopularity{=6}InternetCons
EDU	but I think
EDU	it has hurt the ability of young magicians
EDU	to think
EDU	because so many rely on the internet for everything
RelyOnInternet{<8}NeedBooksForHistoryKnowledge
EDU	and they are n't reading the books .
EDU	We have to have knowledge of the history of magic and what has been done before .
RelyOnInternetOverBooks{=7}InternetDiminishesTheExperience
EDU	Moreover , seeing someone perform on the internet takes away the use of our senses , originality and imagination
EDU	that reading and thinking about magic can produce .
EDU	Anyone can become a monkey ;
EDU	it takes serious study
EDU	to become a magician .
