EDU	How The Onion writes an issue
EDU	This exclusive interview features first-hand journalism by a Wikinews reporter .
EDU	See the collaboration page for more details .
~
EDU	How do you decide on the stories ?
Question{<3}Response
EDU	We do everything backwards here .
EDU	We start with the headline
EDU	and then flesh out the story ,
Backwards{>5}NYTComparison
EDU	as opposed to The New York Times ,
EDU	which writes the issue
EDU	and then has a headline editor
EDU	to make it snappy .
ComparisonWithNYT{<4}ProcessAndStoryDevelopment
EDU	We start with a joke .
EDU	We read about six hundred to eight hundred headline ideas on a Monday
EDU	coming from our staff and a small group of writers outside
EDU	— a contributing core .
EDU	We whittle that down on a Monday to about a hundred ,
ChooseHeadlinesMonday{=8}BrainstormOnTuesday
EDU	come in Tuesday
EDU	and pick an issue
EDU	and brainstorm with the whole editorial staff ;
EDU	all fifteen of us .
DevelopingHeadlines{=7}WritingEditingGraphics
EDU	Then we assign a headline to a specific writer
EDU	to execute .
EDU	We go through a number of drafts
AssignToWriterAndDrafts{=8}EditorsAndGraphics
EDU	and then have the editors pick it up
EDU	and assign the photojournalism aspect of it to our graphic design team ,
EDU	who adds the visual aspect to it .
ProcessDivisionOfLabor{>6}Publication
EDU	The editors punch it up over the last couple of days
EDU	and then it goes out over the Internet and into the print edition .
Process{=5}WhoComesUpWithStory
EDU	So you do n’t have writers
EDU	coming up with a story and headline ,
AskWritersCreateStory{=7}InsteadTeamOfWriters
EDU	but you will instead have a team of writers
EDU	choosing the best headlines
EDU	and then assign it to a particular writer
EDU	who was not necessarily involved ?
FollowUpQuestion{<6}WhoComesUpWithIdeas
EDU	Writers will occasionally write their own headlines ,
EDU	but we come up with a list of 15 or 20 headline ideas ,
EDU	what we think
EDU	will make a good story
Team{=7}AssignBasedOnWriter'sStrengths
EDU	and then we assign it
EDU	based upon what people ’s writing strengths are .
AssignBasedOnWritersStrengths{>8}Examples
EDU	We have some people
EDU	who are great at politics ;
SomePeoplePolitics{=9}SomePeopleWarAndEntertainment
EDU	some people
EDU	we give all the war stuff to ;
EDU	someone
EDU	who is in charge of the Britney Spears story of the week
EDU	— the entertainment stories .
WritingStoriesProcess{=2}Originality
EDU	The headlines
EDU	Editorial Manager Chet Clem and President Sean Mills .

ImageCaption{<4}Question
EDU	It seems like some publications , like AM New York , always have a Britney Spears story ;
EDU	is there anything similar with The Onion
EDU	where they continually revisit a topic or person ?
QuestionAndImageCaption{<3}Response
EDU	No , not necessarily .
EDU	We are a little less reactionary .
EDU	We tend to target the zeitgeist more than anything .
LessReactionary{<6}TargetsAndMean-Spirited
EDU	We ’ll hit the mainstream media ’s portrayal of the entertainment world as much
EDU	as we ’ll hit characters in the entertainment world .
EDU	We ’ll attack People Magazine ’s coverage of Britney as much as Britney .
Targets{=7}ColbertQuoteMean-Spirited
EDU	In an interview with Terry Gross , Stephen Colbert said of his time at Second City
EDU	that they had decided on not doing political humor and , in particular , hackneyed political humor such as Ted Kennedy drinking jokes .
EDU	They felt
EDU	it was overdone , mean-spirited and not funny .
AllFairGame{=5}CrossingLines
EDU	Do your writers have similar rules of thumb ?
Question{<6}Response
EDU	We do n’t have any rules or known lines
EDU	we wo n’t cross .
NoRulesOrLines{<7}SharedUnderstanding
EDU	We have an understanding
EDU	based upon having the same writers in the back room for years ,
EDU	and those writers training the new writers
EDU	as they come in .
SameWriters{=8}OnlyNeedToBeFunny
EDU	There is an understanding in the room .
EDU	If it makes the room laugh ,
EDU	it probably ends up in the paper .
OriginalityAndMean-Spirited{=4}J-LoExampleAndCreativity
EDU	One example is we ran an article a couple of years back
EDU	that was , " No Jennifer Lopez News Today " .
Headline{=7}ReactionToOtherOutlets
EDU	That was our reaction to all of the J-Lo stuff .
EDU	We were n’t going to touch on her dress , or who she was dating .
EDU	Just the fact
EDU	that those were the lead stories for so many days , in everything from US Weekly to Time Magazine .
J-LoHeadline{=6}ImportanceOriginalTake
EDU	I think
EDU	it ’s important we have an original take on those things .
EDU	I think
EDU	it ’s similar to what Colbert said to Terry Gross .
OriginalTake{>7}AvoidRepeatOtherOutlets
EDU	We do n’t want to just traffic in the same 24 hour news cycle .
EDU	There ’s a 24 hour comedy news cycle
EDU	that exists on all the late night talk shows .
J-LoExample{<5}OnionIsOriginal
EDU	The Onion has a different creative process
EDU	where we are not trying to hit everything in the 24 hours and on the same notes .
EDU	We want an original take .
EDU	If we choose to do something on J-Lo ,
EDU	it ’s going to be something like that , something less obvious .
DecidingMaterialAndContent{=1}CompanyCulture
EDU	When you are going through the headlines ,
EDU	is it just you guys sitting around
EDU	trying to crack each other up ?
MainQuestion{<3}MainResponse
EDU	It ’s the least amount of fun possible .
EDU	Nah , I ’m kidding .
JokeResponse{<4}ActualResponse
EDU	It ’s actually more businesslike
EDU	than you ’d imagine .
EDU	It ’s very much like you are trying to make the room laugh ,
EDU	but the room has been a sort of captive audience for many many years now ,
EDU	so it takes a lot to make the room laugh .
BusinesslikeToughAudience{=5}Experience
EDU	The best analogy
EDU	I ’ve heard
EDU	is when Rob Siegel , former editor-in-chief , likened it to wine tasting .
WineTastingAnalogy{<7}QuietExperience
EDU	It ’s this quiet experience
EDU	where you are trying to soak in what the joke is ,
EDU	have we done anything like this ,
EDU	is it a unique take ,
EDU	what are other people doing .
SoakInJokeReflectOriginality{=8}Subdued
EDU	It ’s sort of like , " Hmmm ... that ’s hilarious .
EDU	That ’s really really funny "
EDU	rather than people falling off their chairs .
NotRowdy{<9}MoreSubdued
EDU	It ’s more subdued
EDU	than I think
EDU	what most people would expect .
AnalogyAndSubdued{=6}MoreElaboration
EDU	It ’s more analytical and clinical ?
FollowUpQuestion{<7}Response
EDU	Not all the time ,
EDU	but it ca n’t be a laugh a minute .
EDU	Yeah , what you see on Studio 60 and 30 Rock , those are scripted writers rooms .
EDU	Everything is funny there .
ComparisonScriptedWriters{<8}UnfunnyJokesStayBehind
EDU	There 's a lot of unfunny jokes
EDU	that are told in a back room ,
EDU	that 's why they stay
EDU	and die in that back room
EDU	and do n’t go out in The Onion .
GoingThroughHeadlinesEnvironment{=2}RemovingUnfunnyWriters
EDU	If someone is continually telling unfunny jokes ,
EDU	do you eventually fire them ?
Question{<3}Response
EDU	That ’s why we are on the 10th floor
EDU	to make sure
EDU	they die
EDU	when they get kicked out .
EDU	It can be a real mess on Broadway .
JokeResponse{<4}Answer
EDU	By the time you get to be a writer for The Onion , though ,
EDU	the odds are you are going to succeed
WillLikelySucceed{<6}ChallengingToBecomeWriter
EDU	because we make it pretty challenging .
EDU	You go through quite a bit .
ChallengingProcess{<7}AlreadyProvenGoodWriter
EDU	You will already have demonstrated a pretty long successful record
EDU	of writing stuff for us
EDU	before you will be in that room on a daily basis .
WritersAlreadyProvenThemselves{=5}DoRemoveUnfunnyWriters
EDU	But
EDU	if somebody wakes up one morning
EDU	and suddenly no longer is funny ,
IfSuddenlyNoLongerfunny{=6}OutTheDoor
EDU	then yeah , head first , out the door as quickly
EDU	as possible ,
EDU	and as sadistically
EDU	as possible .
