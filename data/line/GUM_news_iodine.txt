EDU	Australian children suffering from iodine deficiency
EDU	Thursday , February 23 , 2006
~
EDU	Almost half of all Australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient ,
EDU	researchers say .
MainStatistic{<4}NewStudy
EDU	A new study
EDU	documenting iodine nutritional status in Australian school children
EDU	has revealed
EDU	many are not getting enough iodine
Findings{=3}RisksOfIodineDeficiency
EDU	- which can lead to mental and growth retardation .
EDU	The report 's authors say
EDU	iodine deficiency is " the sleeper health issue in Australia " , and potentially a very serious one .
IntroIssue{>2}DetailsOfStudy
EDU	The results of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study
EDU	published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week ,
EDU	revealed
EDU	that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient .
EDU	The report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised .
IntroStudyMainFindings{>4}Details
EDU	They say
EDU	adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method
EDU	of preventing iodine deficiency disorders .
Solution{=5}Details
EDU	A cross-sectional survey of 1709 schoolchildren
EDU	- aged 8 – 10 years , from 88 schools -
EDU	was carried out in New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia and Queensland , between July 2003 and December 2004 .
ChildrenAndLocations{>7}TasmaniaExcluded
EDU	Tasmania was excluded from the study
EDU	- where an voluntary iodine fortification program
EDU	using iodised salt in bread ,
EDU	is ongoing .
SamplePool{<6}ResultsConfirmIodineDeficiency
EDU	The authors say
EDU	the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population .
DetailsOfTheStudy{=3}CausesRisksAndSolutions
EDU	They call for " urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia . "
EDU	Most iodine in food comes from seafood , milk and iodised salt .
ImplementIodineAndOrigins{=5}RisksAndCompareOtherCountries
EDU	Professor Cres Eastman , Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study , and Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders , says
EDU	it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine .
EDU	Iodine deficiency can lead to serious health problems
EDU	including brain damage , stunted growth and deafness .
RisksOfDeficiency{=6}RemedySituation
EDU	Professor Eastman says
EDU	manufacturers could easily remedy the situation
EDU	by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries .
UseIodizedSaltLikeOthers{>7}AttemptToIodizeSalt
EDU	" I suspect
EDU	they wo n't do that on a voluntary basis ,
EDU	we 've tried so far
EDU	and have n't succeeded ,
PastAttemptsUnsuccessful{<8}ConvinceFoodStandards
EDU	so we 've convinced the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand |
EDU	that all salt should be iodised , "
EDU	he said .
ObtainIodineAndRisks{<4}CausesAndMoreRisksSolutions
EDU	The report says
EDU	the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry ,
EDU	where chlorine-containing sanitisers have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers .
ChangeInDairyIndustry{<7}ResultsInLessIodine
EDU	Iodine
EDU	released from these chemicals into milk
EDU	has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades ,
EDU	but is now declining .
OneFactorDairyIndustry{=6}FactorDecreasedConsumptionIodizedSalt
EDU	Another contributory factor has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt
EDU	used in foods .
EDU	The report states
EDU	that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods .
FewManufacturersUseIodizedSalt{>7}Statistic
EDU	Professor Eastman says
EDU	iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation
EDU	that all salt be iodised .
Causes{=5}MoreRisksImpactPregnantWomen
EDU	He says
EDU	authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt .
EastmanCriticizeAuthoritiesSlowness{<7}ImpactsOnDevelopment
EDU	" The effects of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe it is and when it occurs .
EDU	So
EDU	if we go to the pregnant woman ,
EDU	she does n't get enough iodine ,
EDU	she wo n't make enough thyroid hormone ,
PregnantWomanImpact{<8}ImpactOnDevelopment
EDU	and the foetus wo n't get the amount of thyroid hormone
EDU	it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain ,
EDU	so you 'll then see consequences being loss of IQ , learning difficulties , hearing difficulties and other neurological problems , "
EDU	Professor Eastman said .
ImpactOnFetus{=9}ImpactOnDevelopment
EDU	" If an infant 's not getting enough iodine ...
EDU	brain development wo n't be completed
EDU	and they wo n't grow normally ,
InfantWon'tGrowNormally{=10}ImpactsAsChildGrowsOlder
EDU	and as you get older
EDU	the problem will be that you will develop a goiter
EDU	and your thyroid wo n't function as well
EDU	as it should ,
EDU	so that may have all sorts of pernicious effects upon normal function in life . "
RisksForFetus{=6}WHORecommendationsAndEastmanQuotes
EDU	More than two billion people around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency ,
EDU	and yet the problem is easily fixed .
EasilyFixableProblem{<8}WHOFacts
EDU	The World Health Organisation
EDU	( WHO )
EDU	recommends
EDU	that every country should iodise all edible salt .
WHORecommendIodizeAllSalt{=9}IDDEffectsAndBrainDamage
EDU	The most well known effects of IDD are visible goiter and cretinism , a condition
EDU	characterised by severe brain damage
EDU	occurring in very early life .
EDU	WHO say
EDU	Iodine deficiency is the world ’s most prevalent , yet easily preventable , cause of brain damage .
WHORecsAndEasilyPreventable{=7}EastmanAlarmed
EDU	Professor Eastman said
EDU	he is alarmed by what they found .
EDU	" Pregnant women in Australia are getting about half as much
EDU	as what they require on a daily basis .
PregnantWomenDeficient{=9}AdverseEffectsFutureGenerations
EDU	So that alarms me ,
EDU	because there 's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children
EDU	born in this country , "
EDU	he said .
EastmanAlarmed{>8}DevelopedCountryShouldn'tHaveDeficiency
EDU	" If Iodine deficiency is serious
EDU	you lose 15 IQ points , on average .
EDU	There should n't be anyone
EDU	suffering from iodine deficiency in a developed country like Australia . "
NationalIodineStudyAndFindings{>1}InstallingIodineGuidelinesFoodStandards
EDU	Lydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand , says
EDU	they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year .
EDU	She says
EDU	the issue is complicated
EDU	and will take time to get right .
FoodStandardsAttemptAddressProblem{>4}ComplicationReasons
EDU	We need to " make sure there 's sufficient iodine
EDU	added into the food supply ,
EDU	to help those people with a deficiency .
AddressPeopleWithDeficiency{<5}AvoidCausingOverdose
EDU	But at the other end of the scale we 've got to make sure the people
EDU	who eat a lot of food
EDU	- we all know the teenage boy
EDU	who comes home from school
EDU	and eats a whole loaf of bread -
ExampleTeenageBoy{=6}AvoidOverdose
EDU	that those people do n't get too much
EDU	and get overdose , "
EDU	Ms Bauchtman said .
AddressIodineDeficiencyAvoidOverdose{=3}PossibleCausePeopleAvoidSalt
EDU	" One of the reasons
EDU	that iodine is going down
EDU	is because people are taking that good healthy eating message
EDU	and not adding salt during cooking . "
StatementsFromBauchtman{=2}MuLiFutureGenerationsRisk
EDU	Senior researcher Mu Li , of the University of NSW 's school of public health , said
EDU	" it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient ,
EDU	putting the next generation of children
EDU	born in this country
EDU	at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency . "
