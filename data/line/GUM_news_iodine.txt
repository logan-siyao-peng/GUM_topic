1	Australian children suffering from iodine deficiency

~
3	Almost half of all Australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient ,
4	researchers say .

9	- which can lead to mental and growth retardation .
10	The report 's authors say
11	iodine deficiency is " the sleeper health issue in Australia " , and potentially a very serious one .
IntroIssue{>2}DetailsOfStudy
12	The results of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study
13	published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week ,
14	revealed
15	that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient .
16	The report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised .
IntroStudyMainFindings{>4}Details
17	They say
18	adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method
19	of preventing iodine deficiency disorders .
Solution{=5}Details
20	A cross-sectional survey of 1709 schoolchildren
21	- aged 8 – 10 years , from 88 schools -
22	was carried out in New South Wales , Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia and Queensland , between July 2003 and December 2004 .

23	Tasmania was excluded from the study
24	- where an voluntary iodine fortification program
25	using iodised salt in bread ,
26	is ongoing .
SamplePool{<6}ResultsConfirmIodineDeficiency
27	The authors say
28	the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population .
DetailsOfTheStudy{=3}CausesRisksAndSolutions
29	They call for " urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia . "
30	Most iodine in food comes from seafood , milk and iodised salt .
ImplementIodineAndOrigins{=5}RisksAndCompareOtherCountries
31	Professor Cres Eastman , Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study , and Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders , says
32	it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine .
33	Iodine deficiency can lead to serious health problems
34	including brain damage , stunted growth and deafness .
RisksOfDeficiency{=6}RemedySituation
35	Professor Eastman says
36	manufacturers could easily remedy the situation
37	by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries .
UseIodizedSaltLikeOthers{>7}AttemptToIodizeSalt
38	" I suspect
39	they wo n't do that on a voluntary basis ,
40	we 've tried so far
41	and have n't succeeded ,
PastAttemptsUnsuccessful{<8}ConvinceFoodStandards
42	so we 've convinced the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand |
43	that all salt should be iodised , "
44	he said .
ObtainIodineAndRisks{<4}CausesAndMoreRisksSolutions
45	The report says
46	the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry ,
47	where chlorine-containing sanitisers have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers .
ChangeInDairyIndustry{<7}ResultsInLessIodine
48	Iodine
49	released from these chemicals into milk
50	has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades ,
51	but is now declining .
OneFactorDairyIndustry{=6}FactorDecreasedConsumptionIodizedSalt
52	Another contributory factor has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt
53	used in foods .
54	The report states
55	that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods .
FewManufacturersUseIodizedSalt{>7}Statistic
56	Professor Eastman says
57	iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation
58	that all salt be iodised .

59	He says
60	authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt .
EastmanCriticizeAuthoritiesSlowness{<7}ImpactsOnDevelopment
61	" The effects of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe it is and when it occurs .
62	So
63	if we go to the pregnant woman ,
64	she does n't get enough iodine ,
65	she wo n't make enough thyroid hormone ,
PregnantWomanImpact{<8}ImpactOnDevelopment
66	and the foetus wo n't get the amount of thyroid hormone
67	it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain ,
68	so you 'll then see consequences being loss of IQ , learning difficulties , hearing difficulties and other neurological problems , "
69	Professor Eastman said .
ImpactOnFetus{=9}ImpactOnDevelopment
70	" If an infant 's not getting enough iodine ...
71	brain development wo n't be completed
72	and they wo n't grow normally ,
InfantWon'tGrowNormally{=10}ImpactsAsChildGrowsOlder
73	and as you get older
74	the problem will be that you will develop a goiter
75	and your thyroid wo n't function as well
76	as it should ,
77	so that may have all sorts of pernicious effects upon normal function in life . "
RisksForFetus{=6}WHORecommendationsAndEastmanQuotes
78	More than two billion people around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency ,
79	and yet the problem is easily fixed .
EasilyFixableProblem{<8}WHOFacts
80	The World Health Organisation
81	( WHO )
82	recommends
83	that every country should iodise all edible salt .
WHORecommendIodizeAllSalt{=9}IDDEffectsAndBrainDamage
84	The most well known effects of IDD are visible goiter and cretinism , a condition
85	characterised by severe brain damage
86	occurring in very early life .
87	WHO say
88	Iodine deficiency is the world ’s most prevalent , yet easily preventable , cause of brain damage .
WHORecsAndEasilyPreventable{=7}EastmanAlarmed
89	Professor Eastman said
90	he is alarmed by what they found .
91	" Pregnant women in Australia are getting about half as much
92	as what they require on a daily basis .
PregnantWomenDeficient{=9}AdverseEffectsFutureGenerations
93	So that alarms me ,
94	because there 's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children
95	born in this country , "
96	he said .
EastmanAlarmed{>8}DevelopedCountryShouldn'tHaveDeficiency
97	" If Iodine deficiency is serious
98	you lose 15 IQ points , on average .
99	There should n't be anyone
100	suffering from iodine deficiency in a developed country like Australia . "
NationalIodineStudyAndFindings{>1}InstallingIodineGuidelinesFoodStandards
101	Lydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand , says
102	they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year .
103	She says
104	the issue is complicated
105	and will take time to get right .
FoodStandardsAttemptAddressProblem{>4}ComplicationReasons
106	We need to " make sure there 's sufficient iodine
107	added into the food supply ,
108	to help those people with a deficiency .
AddressPeopleWithDeficiency{<5}AvoidCausingOverdose
109	But at the other end of the scale we 've got to make sure the people
110	who eat a lot of food
111	- we all know the teenage boy
112	who comes home from school
113	and eats a whole loaf of bread -
ExampleTeenageBoy{=6}AvoidOverdose
114	that those people do n't get too much
115	and get overdose , "
116	Ms Bauchtman said .
AddressIodineDeficiencyAvoidOverdose{=3}PossibleCausePeopleAvoidSalt
117	" One of the reasons
118	that iodine is going down
119	is because people are taking that good healthy eating message
120	and not adding salt during cooking . "
StatementsFromBauchtman{=2}MuLiFutureGenerationsRisk
121	Senior researcher Mu Li , of the University of NSW 's school of public health , said
122	" it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient ,
123	putting the next generation of children
124	born in this country
125	at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency . "
