EDU	of me vlogging .

EDU	It 's kind of an interesting week .

EDU	and show you what it 's all about ,
VlogIntro{<1}DayOneTwoAndClosing
EDU	and today I 'm on general nuclear medicine ,

DayOneRotation{>5}Details
EDU	So like I said ,
EDU	I 'm on my general nuclear medicine rotation this week .
RotationThisWeek{<7}RotationExplanation
EDU	I get switched around --
EDU	moved around a few times
EDU	to cover some residents
EDU	who are on vacation ,
EDU	so I 'll be at other spots later this week .
RotationOverview{<6}DayWork
EDU	So so far this morning I 've just read a few studies
EDU	( it 's a little slow in the morning )
EDU	of general nuclear medicine
SlowMorning{>9}SlowMorningExplanation
EDU	because a lot of stuff takes time
EDU	for the radio tracers to go into the body or the specific organ
EDU	we are targeting ,
EDU	so we have to wait a little bit in the morning .
MorningPrep{=8}Lymphoscintigraphies
EDU	So I 've done three lymphoscintigraphies .
EDU	For lymphoscintigraphies we basically inject technetium in skin
EDU	surrounding a melanoma
WhatTheyDoToPatient{>10}AfterLymphoInjection
EDU	and after we inject
EDU	we wait about 15 - 20 minutes , maybe up to an hour ,
EDU	and wait for that radio tracer to travel to the closest lymph node
EDU	which we would call the sentinel lymph node .
LymphoIntro{=9}LymphoPurpose
EDU	What we do is we mark it under our cameras
EDU	and then the patient will go up to the OR ,
EDU	have the melanoma , a wide excision of the melanoma ,
AfterInjection{<10}LymphoLastStep
EDU	and then they will try to find the lymph node
EDU	that we marked
EDU	and take that one out as well
EDU	to make sure there 's no metastasis .
Lymphoscintigraphies{>7}MorningPlans
EDU	So I 've done three of those this morning .
EDU	I will read a few more scans
EDU	coming up here shortly
EDU	and just trying to tie up some loose ends
EDU	before I go to conference .
