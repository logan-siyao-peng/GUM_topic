1	What 's up YouTube ?
2	So we are going to do a week
3	of me vlogging .
~
4	It 's kind of an interesting week .
5	I bounced around here and there ,
6	so I have to kind of show you guys around
7	and show you what it 's all about ,
VlogIntro{<1}DayOneTwoAndClosing
8	and today I 'm on general nuclear medicine ,
9	so let 's start the day .
DayOneRotation{>5}Details
10	So like I said ,
11	I 'm on my general nuclear medicine rotation this week .
RotationThisWeek{<7}RotationExplanation
12	I get switched around --
13	moved around a few times
14	to cover some residents
15	who are on vacation ,
16	so I 'll be at other spots later this week .
RotationOverview{<6}DayWork
17	So so far this morning I 've just read a few studies
18	( it 's a little slow in the morning )
19	of general nuclear medicine
SlowMorning{>9}SlowMorningExplanation
20	because a lot of stuff takes time
21	for the radio tracers to go into the body or the specific organ
22	we are targeting ,
23	so we have to wait a little bit in the morning .
MorningPrep{=8}Lymphoscintigraphies
24	So I 've done three lymphoscintigraphies .
25	For lymphoscintigraphies we basically inject technetium in skin
26	surrounding a melanoma
WhatTheyDoToPatient{>10}AfterLymphoInjection
27	and after we inject
28	we wait about 15 - 20 minutes , maybe up to an hour ,
29	and wait for that radio tracer to travel to the closest lymph node
30	which we would call the sentinel lymph node .
LymphoIntro{=9}LymphoPurpose
31	What we do is we mark it under our cameras
32	and then the patient will go up to the OR ,
33	have the melanoma , a wide excision of the melanoma ,
AfterInjection{<10}LymphoLastStep
34	and then they will try to find the lymph node
35	that we marked
36	and take that one out as well
37	to make sure there 's no metastasis .
Lymphoscintigraphies{>7}MorningPlans
38	So I 've done three of those this morning .
39	I will read a few more scans
40	coming up here shortly
41	and just trying to tie up some loose ends
42	before I go to conference .
RecapMorningPlans{>8}CheckInLater
43	I 'll check back in afterwards .
DayOneWork{=4}EndDayOne
44	Ah , the sun feels so good on the face .
45	I 'm officially done .
46	It is about 4:00 p.m.
47	We get to head home early today
48	because we finished off the scans ,
EndOfWorkDay{=6}HomePlans
49	and I 'm gon na go home
50	and work out
AnnounceWorkOut{>8}WorkOutElaboration
51	because I was too lazy to do it this morning
52	because for some reason I was tired
53	from having a weekend off ,
54	which makes no sense .
WorkOutPlans{=7}HomePlansRecap
55	But I 'm gon na go work out ,
56	cook something for dinner
RestOfDayOnePlans{>5}DayTwoRepeat
57	and do this all over again tomorrow .
58	We 're on a different rotation tomorrow
59	so stay tuned
60	to find out which one .
DayOne{=3}DayTwo
61	Alright it is day two .
62	It is Tuesday
63	and today I got pulled to ultrasound .
AnnounceDayTwoPosition{>6}UltrasoundsPlans
64	Yes , I do n't know
65	why I got pulled on today ,
66	but I did ,
UltrasoundsUnexpected{<8}UltrasoundsPlans
67	so probably just sit in there ,
68	read some ultrasounds
69	and get out early .
UltrasoundsSpeculations{>7}YoutubeAndCrushingUltrasounds
70	I need to film another YouTube video .
71	Alright so I 've been here
72	just crushing ultrasounds ,
DayTwoUltrasounds{=5}FeelingSick
73	and today I 've been feeling a little under the weather
74	so I 've been , like , yeah ,
75	I 've been like crushing these all day today
76	and then I 'll show you what else I 've been .
FeelingSick{>6}CoughDropStory
77	I picked these up
78	when I was in Amsterdam for ...
79	I got sick
80	when I was on Croatia for vacation .
CoughDropsFromAmsterdam{>9}UnsureLabeling
81	I have no idea what it says ,
82	but I think
83	they 're cough drops ,
UnsureCoughDrops{>11}RequestTranslation
84	so
85	if anybody knows what this says
86	let me know .
UnsureIfCoughDrops{<10}CoughDropsSpeculations
87	But I 'm pretty sure
88	it 's just cough drops with some vitamin C in it .
89	So this is what I have been doing all day
90	is crushing ultrasounds
91	and having Dutch cough drops .
CoughDropSpeculation{>11}RequestTranslation
92	So
93	if anybody speaks Dutch
94	tell me what that means .
WhereObtainedCoughDrops{>8}PharmacyStoryAndWeekendTrip
95	Oh and PS , I usually try to avoid taking medicines
96	that I ca n't read the name of
NormallyAvoidUnknownMedicine{>11}PharmacyLady
97	but I had someone help me at the pharmacy in the airport .
98	She spoke a little bit of English
99	and I think
100	those are actually cough drops ,
PharmacyStory{>10}JustifyEatingCoughDrops
101	so , that 's the only reason
102	I 'm still eating them today .
PharmacyStory{>9}SoreVoice
103	You can tell by my voice
104	it 's a little on the sore side today
FeelingSick{>7}HintWeekendTrip
