EDU	I am often asked
IntroQuestion{<6}WhyPassArticlesLowChances
EDU	why the House passed Articles of Impeachment
EDU	even knowing
EDU	that the odds were slim
EDU	that Senate Republicans would set aside partisanship
EDU	and hear the case as impartial jurors .
WhyBotherPassArticles{<4}StandUpForConstitution
EDU	It is because
EDU	I know
EDU	future generations will look back on this chapter in our history and ask :
FutureGenerationWillLookBack{=6}QuestionsThey'llAsk
EDU	Who stood up for the Constitution and the laws ?

EDU	that the House did its job ,
EDU	followed the law ,

HouseDefendedConstitution{>6}WhatTheyDid
EDU	We did not convict ;
EDU	that is not our role .
RoleIsNotToConvict{=7}ProbableCauseAbuseOfPower
EDU	Essentially , what we said was there was probable cause
EDU	that powers had been abused
EDU	and certainly cause
EDU	to see

EDU	to hold this President accountable ,
EDU	as our Founders intended .
ProudOfHouseColleagues{=4}Trial
EDU	Almost everybody has watched a trial either in person or on television .
WideCoverageOfTheTrial{<5}WhatConstitutesATrial
EDU	A trial is not an opening argument and a closing argument with nothing in between .
NotJustOpeningAndClosing{>6}Elaboration
EDU	Seventy - five percent of our people wanted to have witnesses
EDU	because that was their understanding
EDU	of what a trial is ,
NecessityOfWitnesses{<7}TrialNotJustBeginningEnd
EDU	not just argument at the beginning and argument at the end ,
EDU	but evidence
EDU	for jurors
EDU	who have pledged to be impartial
EDU	to consider .
EDU	Any judge in this country would agree
EDU	that opening and closing statements alone are not a trial .
