FigureCredit{<3}Introduction
EDU	Some scholars believe
EDU	that between nine and fifteen thousand years ago , a land bridge existed between Asia and North America
EDU	that we now call Beringia .
IntroBeringia{<5}CrossBridgeAndStrait
EDU	The first inhabitants of what would be named the Americas migrated across this bridge in search of food .
EDU	When the glaciers melted ,
EDU	water engulfed Beringia ,
EDU	and the Bering Strait was formed .
EDU	Later settlers came by boat across the narrow strait .
CrossBridgeAndStrait{>6}GeneticEvidence
EDU	( The fact
EDU	that Asians and American Indians share genetic markers on a Y chromosome
EDU	lends credibility to this migration theory . )
Migration{=4}SettlementAndAgriculture
EDU	Continually moving southward ,
EDU	the settlers eventually populated both North and South America ,
SettlersPopulateAmericas{>6}Examples
EDU	creating unique cultures
EDU	that ranged from the highly complex and urban Aztec civilization in what is now Mexico City to the woodland tribes of eastern North America .
EDU	Recent research along the west coast of South America suggests
EDU	that migrant populations may have traveled down this coast by water as well as by land .
Settlement{=5}AgricultureAndMapFigure
EDU	Researchers believe
EDU	that about ten thousand years ago , humans also began the domestication of plants and animals ,
EDU	adding agriculture as a means of sustenance to hunting and gathering techniques .
IntroAgriculture{<7}Impact
EDU	With this agricultural revolution , and the more abundant and reliable food supplies
EDU	it brought ,
EDU	populations grew
EDU	and people were able to develop a more settled way of life ,
EDU	building permanent settlements .

EDU	Nowhere in the Americas was this more obvious than in Mesoamerica

EDU	This map shows the extent of the major civilizations of the Western Hemisphere .
EDU	In South America , early civilizations developed along the coast
EDU	because the high Andes and the inhospitable Amazon Basin made the interior of the continent less favorable for settlement .

EDU	THE OLMEC
TheOlmecTitle{<5}Content
EDU	Mesoamerica is the geographic area
EDU	stretching from north of Panama up to the desert of central Mexico .
EDU	Although marked by great topographic , linguistic , and cultural diversity ,
EDU	this region cradled a number of civilizations with similar characteristics .
MesoamericaLocationAndDiversity{=7}Characteristics
EDU	Mesoamericans were polytheistic ;
EDU	their gods possessed both male and female traits
EDU	and demanded blood sacrifices of enemies
EDU	taken in battle
EDU	or ritual bloodletting .
Religion{=9}Diet
EDU	Corn , or maize ,
EDU	domesticated by 5000 BCE ,
EDU	formed the basis of their diet .
ReligionAndDiet{<8}ImportantContributionsAndTrade
EDU	They developed a mathematical system ,
EDU	built huge edifices ,
MathAndEdifices{=10}Calendar
EDU	and devised a calendar
EDU	that accurately predicted eclipses and solstices
EDU	and that priest-astronomers used
EDU	to direct the planting and harvesting of crops .
Inventions{<9}WrittenLanguageAndTrade
EDU	Most important for our knowledge of these peoples ,
EDU	they created the only known written language in the Western Hemisphere ;
EDU	researchers have made much progress
EDU	in interpreting the inscriptions on their temples and pyramids .
WrittenLanguage{>10}Trade
EDU	Though the area had no overarching political structure ,
EDU	trade over long distances helped diffuse culture .
TradeDiffuseCulture{>11}TradeItems

Stone-basedProducts{=12}FeathersCacaoBeans
EDU	feathers
EDU	woven into clothing and ornaments ,
EDU	and cacao beans
EDU	that were whipped into a chocolate drink
EDU	formed the basis of commerce .
IntroMesoamerica{=6}TheOlmec
EDU	The mother of Mesoamerican cultures was the Olmec civilization .
EDU	Flourishing along the hot Gulf Coast of Mexico from about 1200 to about 400 BCE ,
EDU	the Olmec produced a number of major works of art , architecture , pottery , and sculpture .
IntroOlmec{>9}Characteristics
EDU	Most recognizable are their giant head sculptures
EDU	( Figure 1.4 )
EDU	and the pyramid in La Venta .
ImportantBuildings{=10}WaterAndAgriculture
EDU	The Olmec built aqueducts
EDU	to transport water into their cities
EDU	and irrigate their fields .
Aqueducts{=11}Agriculture
EDU	They grew maize , squash , beans , and tomatoes .
EDU	They also bred small domesticated dogs
EDU	which , along with fish , provided their protein .
OlmecIntro{=8}Influence
EDU	Although no one knows
EDU	what happened to the Olmec after about 400 BCE ,
EDU	in part because the jungle reclaimed many of their cities ,
EDU	their culture was the base
EDU	upon which the Maya and the Aztec built .
BaseForMayaAndAztec{=10}ReligiousInfluence
EDU	It was the Olmec
EDU	who worshipped a rain god , a maize god , and the feathered serpent so important in the future pantheons of the Aztecs
EDU	( who called him Quetzalcoatl )
EDU	and the Maya
EDU	( to whom he was Kukulkan ) .
InfluenceOnAztecsAndMaya{>9}ExtensiveTradeSystem
EDU	The Olmec also developed a system of trade throughout Mesoamerica ,
EDU	giving rise to an elite class .

FigureTitle{<8}Caption
EDU	The Olmec carved heads from giant boulders
EDU	that ranged from four to eleven feet in height
EDU	and could weigh up to fifty tons .
EDU	All these figures have flat noses , slightly crossed eyes , and large lips .
EDU	These physical features can be seen today in some of the peoples indigenous to the area .
TheOlmec{=4}TheMaya
EDU	THE MAYA
TheMayaTitle{<5}TheMayaContent
EDU	After the decline of the Olmec , a city rose in the fertile central highlands of Mesoamerica .
EDU	One of the largest population centers in pre-Columbian America and home to more than 100,000 people at its height in about 500 CE ,
EDU	Teotihuacan was located about thirty miles northeast of modern Mexico City .
TeotihuacanCity{>9}Multiethnic
EDU	The ethnicity of this settlement ’s inhabitants is debated ;
EDU	some scholars believe
EDU	it was a multiethnic city .
MayaIntro{=8}BuildingsAndTrade
EDU	Large-scale agriculture and the resultant abundance of food allowed time
EDU	for people to develop special trades and skills other than farming .
EDU	Builders constructed over twenty-two hundred apartment compounds for multiple families , as well as more than a hundred temples .
ManyBuildings{>10}ExamplePyramidsAndTemples
EDU	Among these were the Pyramid of the Sun
EDU	( which is two hundred feet high )
EDU	and the Pyramid of the Moon
EDU	( one hundred and fifty feet high ) .
Pyramids{=11}Temple
EDU	Near the Temple of the Feathered Serpent , graves have been uncovered
EDU	that suggest
EDU	humans were sacrificed for religious purposes .
Buildings{=9}TradeAndTeotihuacan
EDU	The city was also the center for trade ,
EDU	which extended to settlements on Mesoamerica ’s Gulf Coast .
EDU	The Maya were one Mesoamerican culture
EDU	that had strong ties to Teotihuacan .
MayaCharacteristics{=7}ContributionsAndAchievements
EDU	The Maya ’s architectural and mathematical contributions were significant .
IntroContributions{>9}Elaboration
EDU	Flourishing from roughly 2000 BCE to 900 CE in what is now Mexico , Belize , Honduras , and Guatemala ,
EDU	the Maya perfected the calendar and written language
EDU	the Olmec had begun .
CalendarAndWritingSystem{=10}MathSystem
EDU	They devised a written mathematical system
EDU	to record crop yields and the size of the population ,
EDU	and to assist in trade .
Inventions{=8}ManyCity-States
EDU	Surrounded by farms
EDU	relying on primitive agriculture ,
EDU	they built the city-states of Copan , Tikal , and Chichen Itza along their major trade routes , as well as temples , statues of gods , pyramids , and astronomical observatories
EDU	( Figure 1.5 ) .
MayaCharacteristicsAndContributions{=6}Downfall
EDU	However ,
EDU	because of poor soil and a drought
EDU	that lasted nearly two centuries ,
EDU	their civilization declined by about 900 CE
EDU	and they abandoned their large population centers .

DownfallAndFigure{=7}SpanishFindingsAndRemains
EDU	The Spanish found little organized resistance among the weakened Maya upon their arrival in the 1520s .

EDU	However , they did find Mayan history , in the form of glyphs , or pictures
EDU	representing words ,
EDU	recorded in folding books
EDU	called codices

Codices{>9}BurnCodices
EDU	In 1562 , Bishop Diego de Landa ,

EDU	collected and burned every codex
