EDU	I know

EDU	that you guys have requested for a very long time ,
EDU	and after two and a half years
EDU	of living here ,
LongRequested{=2}ReadyToGiveTour
EDU	I finally feel
EDU	like I 've made it my own
EDU	and decorated it
EDU	how I want ,
EDU	and I 'm ready to show it to you guys .
VideoIntro{<1}TourBegins
EDU	Alright so let 's start off with the bed and the couch area .
IntroStartBedCouchArea{<2}Tour
EDU	Honestly ,
EDU	if I was redoing this from the beginning ,
EDU	I would have really liked to have a double bed in this room ,
BedCouchAreaRedo{<5}BedCouchAreaSmallSpace
EDU	but , unfortunately , with the space
EDU	as you can probably see from that wall there till the door ,
EDU	it 's basically just enough
EDU	to fit a bed and a couch ,
SpaceRestrictions{<4}CouchArea
EDU	and this is my couch over here .
CouchIntro{>6}CouchDetails
EDU	I 've recently changed it ,
EDU	and
EDU	if you 've been following my channel for a long time ,
EDU	then you 'll know
EDU	I 'm really proud of how I color match the pictures on the wall over here with sort of the gray and yellow vibe , the gray and yellow cushions .
CouchAesthetics{=7}CouchSpaceAccommodation
EDU	This couch is also quite big ,
EDU	it fits three people quite comfortably ,
EDU	and
EDU	if I have family or friends staying over ,
EDU	it opens up into a full double bed .
CouchDescription{=5}CoffeeTable
EDU	This coffee table over here , it 's glass
EDU	and has two levels ,
CoffeeTableDescription{<6}CoffeeTableUsages
EDU	so it 's really good
EDU	when we have multiple friends over ,
EDU	and we have lots of food
EDU	to put on the table ,
CoffeeTableFoodSpace{=7}CoffeeTableBoardGameSpace
EDU	or
EDU	if we 're playing board games ,
EDU	we can have people sit around it ,
EDU	and still have a lot of space
EDU	to lay everything out .
CouchArea{=3}BedArea
EDU	So there 's nothing too special about the bed itself ,
EDU	but it does have a very important function ,
EDU	which , it has a lot of storage .
BedStorageIntro{>7}BedStoragePurpose
EDU	So down here is basically where I keep everything
EDU	that I ca n't really keep in my room ,
EDU	because there 's not enough space .
BedStorageIntro{>6}BedStorageContents
EDU	I 've got an ironing board , all of my suitcases , socks , clothes
EDU	that I do n't wear that often ,
NonToolsRelatedContents{=7}ToolsRelatedContents
EDU	anything
EDU	that I need
EDU	for fixing the house
EDU	like screwdrivers , drills , nails , all these things
ToolsList{<8}GeneralDescription
EDU	that I definitely would n't want to have laid out in my room ,
EDU	but I still need somewhere in the house .
BedStorage{=5}BalconyAndFilmGear
EDU	I love that this room has floor-to-ceiling windows as well ,
EDU	it really lets the light come in , especially in the summer time .
Windows{>8}LondonLackOfLight
EDU	I know
EDU	London does n't have that much light ,
EDU	but I 'll take as much
EDU	as I can ,
Lighting{=7}Balcony
EDU	and there 's also a small balcony out here ,
EDU	which is fairly rare for London .
BalconyIntro{>9}BalconyDescription
EDU	We have two chairs
EDU	where we can sit down
EDU	and sort of enjoy the weather
EDU	when it is a little bit better ,
Balcony{>8}CloseBalcony
EDU	um but now it 's really cold
EDU	so just gon na close it .
Balcony{=6}FilmGear
EDU	And then a little behind the scenes
EDU	that you probably will never see again in a video
FilmGearStorageLocationIntro{<7}FilmGearList
EDU	is that down here I keep all of the filming gear
EDU	that does n't really fit anywhere else in the room :
EDU	two sets of tripods ,
EDU	I also have a c-stand .
BedStorageAndBalcony{=4}BedsideAndWall
EDU	Okay next to my bed , I 've got the radio alarm clock ,
RadioAlarmClockIntro{>6}WakingUpEarly
EDU	and this has actually changed my life .
EDU	It makes waking up in the morning and getting out of bed at 6:00 a.m.
EDU	when it 's pitch black outside
EDU	so much easier
EDU	when you 're waking up really early .
RadioAlarmClockImportance{>7}RadioAlarmClockComparison
EDU	It 's so much better to wake up to the sound
EDU	of somebody talking to you :
EDU	your favorite radio station , some music , whatever ,
EDU	instead of that classic iPhone alarm , " ba , ba , ba . "
RadioAlarmClock{=5}WallPosters
EDU	Over here on the wall , these are posters
EDU	that I actually bought back in 2013 in my first year of university in Toronto ,
EDU	and I really really liked them
EDU	so I 've kept them around .
WallPostersIntro{>6}WallPostersFeelings
EDU	Also I 'm really proud
EDU	that I managed to put them up all by myself ,
EDU	they look quite neat ,
EDU	and I feel
EDU	like they 're equally spaced ,
WallPostersLook{>7}WallPostersPride
EDU	so I 'm really proud of how they turned out .
