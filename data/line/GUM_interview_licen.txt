EDU	and was a member of the UNESCO Slovenian National Commission .
EDU	He was also the Team Manager of the Slovenian wheelchair basketball national team .
Intro{<1}Interview
EDU	Why do you think
EDU	the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US
EDU	compared to other countries like Australia , the United Kingdom and even Canada ?
Question{<3}Response
EDU	Sports in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society .
EDU	It emphasizes consumerism , the belief
EDU	that success always goes to people
EDU	who merit it due to their abilities , dedication and qualifications ,
SportsReaffirmExistingPowerRelations{=5}SameForGenderEthnicityNationality
EDU	and reinforces ,
EDU	rather than changes ,
EDU	existing ideas
EDU	related to gender , ethnicity and nationality .
ReaffirmExistingPowerRelations{<4}ParalympicsGoesAgainstThat
EDU	Paralympic sport brings attention to athletes
EDU	who are typically overlooked in American society
EDU	because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people
EDU	who are disabled .
AvoidIdentifyWithDisabled{>6}QuestionMasculinity
EDU	Although disability is not contagious ,
EDU	interest in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males
EDU	following it .
AvoidIdentifyWithDisabled{=5}ChallengeExistingPowerRelations
EDU	Disabled athletes also challenge existing relations of power
EDU	by displaying dedication , hard work and perseverance in different contexts
EDU	than those most sports fans are accustomed to .
ParalympicLittleVisibilityUS{=2}FirstTimeTelevisedUS
EDU	Other countries ,
EDU	including the ones
EDU	you mention ,
EDU	have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society .
OtherCountries{=5}US
EDU	Even though legislative support may be less strong
EDU	than the one
EDU	provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act ,
LegislativeSupport{=6}SocialInstitutions
EDU	many social institutions
EDU	including the media
EDU	are more receptive to this form of diversity .
QuestionBackground{<4}Question
EDU	What do you think
EDU	the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be
EDU	with the Games being televised live in the United States for first time ?
Question{<3}Response
EDU	The impact depends on a number of aspects .
MultipleAspects{<4}Factors
EDU	One of them is the channels
EDU	that NBC as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use
EDU	to air the Paralympic Games on .
EDU	Will they be shown nationally or regionally , on NBC or on any of the company ’s multiple cable networks ?
Channels{=6}TimeOfDay
EDU	A second aspect is the parts or hours of the day
EDU	the Paralympics will be shown .
EDU	Remember
EDU	that there is a nine-hour difference between Sochi and New York , and a 12-hour difference between Sochi and the US West Coast .
TimeDifference{<7}LiveBroadcastTimeDiscrepancy
EDU	So daytime events will be shown live in the United States in the middle of the night ,
EDU	and evening prime-time events will be shown
EDU	— indeed live —
EDU	in the morning U.S. time .
Discrepancy{>8}LessGlamarous
EDU	So showing the Paralympics live on United States television might turn out to be less glamorous
EDU	than it appears .
ChannelAndTimeBroadcast{=5}EventMediation
EDU	A third important factor is the way
EDU	the event will be mediated :
WayEventIsMediated{>7}MediatedAndEducated
EDU	will NBC have its best sports broadcasters
EDU	following the event
EDU	after having worked the Winter Olympics ?
Casters{=9}TreatCompetition
EDU	Will they treat and announce the competitions
EDU	as they do all others
EDU	— for better and worse ?
HowTreatCompetition{=8}OpportunityToEducate
EDU	Will they take it as an opportunity
EDU	to educate viewers about disability and diversity
EDU	while showing superb athletic performances
EDU	without engaging in a discourse of pity ?
EventMediation{>6}WaitToEvaluateMeetExpectations
EDU	All in all , I think
EDU	this is a terrific opportunity
EDU	to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects ;
EDU	but we will have to wait until after the event
EDU	to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations .
