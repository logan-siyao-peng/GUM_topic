EDU	Why the Division of Labor Increases Production
~
EDU	When we divide and subdivide the tasks
EDU	involved with producing a good or service ,
EDU	workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output .
MainObservation{>2}ElaborationAndQuestion
EDU	In his observations of pin factories , Smith noticed
IntroPinFactories{<4}Observations
EDU	that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day ,
EDU	but that a small business of 10 workers
EDU	( some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks
EDU	involved with pin-making ) ,
EDU	could make 48,000 pins in a day .
Elaboration{<3}QuestionOfInterest
EDU	How can a group of workers ,
EDU	each specializing in certain tasks ,
EDU	produce so much more than the same number of workers
EDU	who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves ?
IntroScenarioAndQuestion{=1}ThreeReasonsAndConclusion
EDU	Smith offered three reasons .
SmithOfferedThreeReasons{<3}Reasons
EDU	First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process
EDU	where they have an advantage .
Specialization{>6}Sidenote
EDU	( In later chapters , we will develop this idea
EDU	by discussing comparative advantage . )
Specialization{>5}ExplanationAndRecap
EDU	People have different skills , talents , and interests ,
EDU	so they will be better at some jobs than at others .
SpecializationMeaning{>7}Examples
EDU	The particular advantages may be based on educational choices ,
EDU	which are in turn shaped by interests and talents .
EDU	Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors , for instance .
EducationInterestDegrees{=8}Geography
EDU	For some goods , geography affects specialization .
EDU	For example , it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota
EDU	than in Florida ,
EDU	but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida
EDU	than in North Dakota .
FloridaNorthDakotaExamples{=9}AnotherGenericExample
EDU	If you live in or near a big city ,
EDU	it is easier to attract enough customers
EDU	to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater
EDU	than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area .
Explanation{<6}Recap
EDU	Whatever the reason ,
EDU	if people specialize in the production
EDU	of what they do best ,
EDU	they will be more effective
MoreEfficientIfSpecializedWork{=7}ComparedToCombinationOfWork
EDU	than if they produce a combination of things ,
EDU	some of which they are good at
EDU	and some of which they are not .
FirstReason{=4}SecondAndThirdReasons
EDU	Second , workers
EDU	who specialize in certain tasks
EDU	often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality .
LearnFasterHigherQuality{>6}ExplanationAndAnalogy
EDU	This pattern holds true for many workers ,
IntroPattern{>9}ListExamples
EDU	including assembly line laborers
EDU	who build cars ,
AssemblyLineLaborers{=10}StylistsAndDoctors
EDU	stylists
EDU	who cut hair ,
EDU	and doctors
EDU	who perform heart surgery .
PatternHoldsTrueAcrossJobs{=8}SuggestInnovativeWays
EDU	In fact , specialized workers often know their jobs well enough
EDU	to suggest innovative ways
EDU	to do their work faster and better .
Explanation{>7}Analogy
EDU	A similar pattern often operates within businesses .
IntroAnalogyBusiness{<8}CoreCompetencyVsManyProducts
EDU	In many cases , a business
EDU	that focuses on one or a few products
EDU	( sometimes called its “ core competency ” )
EDU	is more successful than firms
EDU	that try to make a wide range of products .
SecondReason{=5}ThirdReason
EDU	Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale ,
IntroEconomiesOfScale{>7}Explanation
EDU	which means that for many goods ,
EDU	as the level of production increases ,
EDU	the average cost
EDU	of producing each individual unit
EDU	declines .
EconomiesOfScale{>6}Explanation
EDU	For example ,
EDU	if a factory produces only 100 cars per year ,
EDU	each car will be quite expensive to make on average .
FactoryWith100Cars{<7}ProduceMoreCarsLowerCosts
EDU	However ,
EDU	if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year ,
EDU	then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers
EDU	performing specialized tasks ,
EDU	and the average cost of production per car will be lower .
ThreeReasons{<2}Conclusion
EDU	The ultimate result of workers
EDU	who can focus on their preferences and talents ,
EDU	learn to do their specialized jobs better ,
EDU	and work in larger organizations
TheThreeFactors{=3}Result
EDU	is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more
EDU	than if each person tried to produce all of his or her own goods and services .
EDU	The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity .
