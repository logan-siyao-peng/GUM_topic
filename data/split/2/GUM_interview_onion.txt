1	The Onion :
2	An interview with ' America 's Finest News Source '

4	How The Onion writes an issue
5	This exclusive interview features first - hand journalism by a Wikinews reporter .
6	See the collaboration page for more details .
7	How do you decide on the stories ?
8	We do everything backwards here .
9	We start with the headline
10	and then flesh out the story ,
11	as opposed to The New York Times ,
12	which writes the issue
13	and then has a headline editor
14	to make it snappy .
15	We start with a joke .
16	We read about six hundred to eight hundred headline ideas on a Monday
17	coming from our staff and a small group of writers outside
18	— a contributing core .
19	We whittle that down on a Monday to about a hundred ,
20	come in Tuesday
21	and pick an issue
22	and brainstorm with the whole editorial staff ;
23	all fifteen of us .
24	Then we assign a headline to a specific writer
25	to execute .
26	We go through a number of drafts
27	and then have the editors pick it up
28	and assign the photojournalism aspect of it to our graphic design team ,
29	who adds the visual aspect to it .
30	The editors punch it up over the last couple of days
31	and then it goes out over the Internet and into the print edition .
32	So you do n’t have writers
33	coming up with a story and headline ,
34	but you will instead have a team of writers
35	choosing the best headlines
36	and then assign it to a particular writer
37	who was not necessarily involved ?
38	Writers will occasionally write their own headlines ,
39	but we come up with a list of 15 or 20 headline ideas ,
40	what we think
41	will make a good story
42	and then we assign it
43	based upon what people ’s writing strengths are .
44	We have some people
45	who are great at politics ;
46	some people
47	we give all the war stuff to ;
48	someone
49	who is in charge of the Britney Spears story of the week
50	— the entertainment stories .

55	It seems like some publications , like AM New York , always have a Britney Spears story ;
56	is there anything similar with The Onion
57	where they continually revisit a topic or person ?
58	No , not necessarily .
59	We are a little less reactionary .
60	We tend to target the zeitgeist more than anything .
61	We ’ll hit the mainstream media ’s portrayal of the entertainment world as much
62	as we ’ll hit characters in the entertainment world .
63	We ’ll attack People Magazine ’s coverage of Britney as much as Britney .
64	In an interview with Terry Gross , Stephen Colbert said of his time at Second City
65	that they had decided on not doing political humor and , in particular , hackneyed political humor such as Ted Kennedy drinking jokes .
66	They felt
67	it was overdone , mean - spirited and not funny .
68	Do your writers have similar rules of thumb ?
69	We do n’t have any rules or known lines
70	we wo n’t cross .
71	We have an understanding
72	based upon having the same writers in the back room for years ,
73	and those writers training the new writers
74	as they come in .
75	There is an understanding in the room .
76	If it makes the room laugh ,
77	it probably ends up in the paper .
78	One example is we ran an article a couple of years back
79	that was , " No Jennifer Lopez News Today " .
80	That was our reaction to all of the J - Lo stuff .
81	We were n’t going to touch on her dress , or who she was dating .
82	Just the fact
83	that those were the lead stories for so many days , in everything from US Weekly to Time Magazine .
84	I think
85	it ’s important we have an original take on those things .
86	I think
87	it ’s similar to what Colbert said to Terry Gross .
88	We do n’t want to just traffic in the same 24 hour news cycle .
89	There ’s a 24 hour comedy news cycle
90	that exists on all the late night talk shows .
91	The Onion has a different creative process
92	where we are not trying to hit everything in the 24 hours and on the same notes .
93	We want an original take .
94	If we choose to do something on J - Lo ,
95	it ’s going to be something like that , something less obvious .

96	When you are going through the headlines ,
97	is it just you guys sitting around
98	trying to crack each other up ?
99	It ’s the least amount of fun possible .
100	Nah , I ’m kidding .
101	It ’s actually more businesslike
102	than you ’d imagine .
103	It ’s very much like you are trying to make the room laugh ,
104	but the room has been a sort of captive audience for many many years now ,
105	so it takes a lot to make the room laugh .
106	The best analogy
107	I ’ve heard
108	is when Rob Siegel , former editor - in - chief , likened it to wine tasting .
109	It ’s this quiet experience
110	where you are trying to soak in what the joke is ,
111	have we done anything like this ,
112	is it a unique take ,
113	what are other people doing .
114	It ’s sort of like , " Hmmm ... that ’s hilarious .
115	That ’s really really funny "
116	rather than people falling off their chairs .
117	It ’s more subdued
118	than I think
119	what most people would expect .
120	It ’s more analytical and clinical ?
121	Not all the time ,
122	but it ca n’t be a laugh a minute .
123	Yeah , what you see on Studio 60 and 30 Rock , those are scripted writers rooms .
124	Everything is funny there .
125	There 's a lot of unfunny jokes
126	that are told in a back room ,
127	that 's why they stay
128	and die in that back room
129	and do n’t go out in The Onion .

130	If someone is continually telling unfunny jokes ,
131	do you eventually fire them ?
132	That ’s why we are on the 10th floor
133	to make sure
134	they die
135	when they get kicked out .
136	It can be a real mess on Broadway .
137	By the time you get to be a writer for The Onion , though ,
138	the odds are you are going to succeed
139	because we make it pretty challenging .
140	You go through quite a bit .
141	You will already have demonstrated a pretty long successful record
142	of writing stuff for us
143	before you will be in that room on a daily basis .
144	But
145	if somebody wakes up one morning
146	and suddenly no longer is funny ,
147	then yeah , head first , out the door as quickly
148	as possible ,
149	and as sadistically
150	as possible .
