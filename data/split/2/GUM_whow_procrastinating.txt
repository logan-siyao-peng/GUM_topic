19	Create a to - do list .
20	Yes ,
21	make yourself an old fashioned to - do list with check boxes and everything .
22	List everything , big and small ,
23	that you have to do for your entire day ;
24	break big activities into smaller bits
25	if necessary .
26	Then ,
27	as you work through your day ,
28	check off each of the items on your list .
29	You will feel a growing sense of pride
30	as you visually monitor your ever - diminishing list of projects .
31	Focus your list on including the things
32	you typically put off ,
33	not the things
34	you are sure to do on a regular basis .
35	If necessary ,
36	set time - frames
37	for your items to be done by .
38	For example , list “ take the dog for a walk by 12:30 ”
39	rather than simply “ walk the dog . ”
40	Re-evaluate your list halfway through your day
41	to rank your items
42	based on highest priority .
43	Then , tackle the most important ones
44	before looking back at the smaller things
45	to do .
46	Keep a notebook by hand
47	before you start your workday .
48	Write every thought down
49	that comes up during work .
50	Every single to do or things
51	you want to do at that specific moment .
52	Do n't do it ,
53	put it on a list
54	and do it later .
55	This prevents you from getting into the " procrastination zone . "
56	Finish the hard stuff .
57	When you have a looming project
58	that 's bogging you down
59	and making you unproductive in other areas ,
60	tackle it first .
61	Finishing the largest item on your list of things
62	to do
63	will make you feel extra productive
64	and give you the boost
65	to do other things
66	you ’ve been pushing to the side .
67	If your “ big project ” is something
68	that ca n’t be done in one sitting ,
69	make a list of small parts of it
70	that you can accomplish today .
71	Do n’t worry about completing the entire thing ,
72	but take steps now
73	so that doing so in the future is a breeze .
74	Make an ultimate to - do list for this single project ,
75	and have it placed somewhere
76	you will see it on a regular basis .
77	As you mark things off ,
78	you will be motivated
79	to continue doing so ,
80	and seeing it on a regular basis will remind you that your project needs to be done .
81	Do two - minute tasks .
82	Whenever you are presented with something
83	that you do n’t want to do
84	or would consider putting off ,
85	ask yourself ,
86	“ will this take me less than two minutes to finish ? ”
87	For many of us , this includes small chores , like taking out the trash or pulling a few weeds ,
88	but can include simple tasks in all areas of life .
89	Anything
90	that you want to put off
91	but takes two minutes
92	to do -
93	do it .
94	Simply force yourself to use the next 120 seconds
95	to be productive
96	and do the duty
97	you normally would push off for hours or days .
98	[ 1 ] .
99	Create a timed work frenzy .
100	If you find yourself being pulled off into the depths of daydreams ,
101	set a period of time
102	to do nothing but work .
103	Take ten minutes
104	and remove all distractions -
105	your phone , magazines , or thoughts of your attractive love -
106	and go into a working frenzy .
107	Force yourself to work productively for ten minutes ,
108	and then go back to whatever it was
109	you were doing .
110	Chances are ,
111	you ’ll get into a groove
112	and keep working at a high pace
113	even when your frenzy time is out .
114	Working with a timer is generally regarded by most experts as being one of the best ways
115	to develop self - discipline
116	and stop procrastination .
117	The most famous method
118	of working to strict time controls
119	( known as time - boxing )
120	involves creating a list of tasks .
121	Each task is then assigned an exact amount of time
122	to complete .
123	If you do n't finish the task in the allotted time ,
124	then you move on to the next one .
125	Using this work arrangement ,
126	it forces you to take action ,
127	as you ca n't afford to waste any time .
128	[ 2 ] .
129	Give yourself a break .
130	If you ca n’t seem to focus
131	and are working half - heartedly at your tasks ,
132	give yourself a brief break .
133	Set a timer for ten minutes ,
134	and take a nap ,
135	read a book ,
136	or call your friend .
137	Do whatever it is
138	you ’ve been daydreaming about
139	so that the temptation is removed
140	once you get back to work .
141	Just be sure to follow through with your deadline
142	rather than ignoring it
143	when your alarm finally goes off .
