1	Interview with LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire
2	Sunday , May 28 , 2006
3	The LibriVox website features a catalog of about a hundred completed books ,
4	including books in other languages like German , Hebrew , and Japanese .
5	Why did you decide to take the acoustic fate of public domain works into your own hands ,
6	and how did you go about it ?
7	I think
8	that a vibrant public domain is very important to a healthy world ,
9	and so I thought :
10	here 's a way
11	to help the cause .
12	I launched LibriVox ,
13	emailed some friends and some podcasters
14	who where doing literary stuff ,
15	and invited them to record a chapter of Joseph Conrad 's Secret Agent .
16	Things have grown steadily since .
17	By the way , AKMA was the first guy
18	I know of
19	to do something like this , with Lawrence Lessig 's Free Culture .
20	That ,
21	I think ,
22	started my thinking about this ,
23	but it took a while for the idea to crystallize .
HowTheIdeaCameAbout{=2}RecordingsAndLogistics
24	Hugh McGuire with some books
25	that have not yet been acoustically liberated .
26	Do you personally record audiobooks ,
27	and did you already do so before LibriVox ?
28	LibriVox was my first experience
29	recording audiobooks .
30	I still do the odd chapter ,
31	but i am a bit delinquent
32	in finishing some of them these days !
33	Is there a particular LibriVox book
34	which
35	you think
36	stands out
37	because of the quality , the overall effort
38	involved ,
39	its popularity , or for some other reason ?
40	My personal favourite is Notes from the Underground
41	( Dostoyevsky ) .
42	Other random good ones :
43	Austen , Jane .
44	Pride and Prejudice
45	Christie , Agatha .
46	The Mysterious Affair at Styles
47	London , Jack .
48	White Fang
49	Macaulay , Thomas Babington .
50	History of England
51	( Volume 1 , Chapter 1 )
52	Marx , Karl and Engels , Friedrich .
53	The Communist Manifesto
54	( solo )
55	Twain , Mark .
56	A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court
57	( solo )
58	Ed. :
59	See the LibriVox catalog for a full index .
60	Browsing the catalog ,
61	I find
62	that the quality of the spoken audio varies greatly from text to text or even from chapter to chapter .
63	If someone wanted to re-record a chapter
64	because they did n't like the speaker ,
65	would you then offer two versions ?
66	Yes .
67	We take the Wikipedia approach :
68	if you think
69	it should be better ,
70	please help it be so .
71	You 'll note
72	we offer a couple of versions of some books .
73	Indeed our weekly poetry project celebrates this diversity of voice :
74	each week a new short poem is chosen
75	and as many readers
76	as wish to
77	record a version ,
78	so you get 20 + versions of the same poem , a very interesting audio experience .
LibriVoxIntroAndDetails{=1}LibriVoxPublicDomainLicense
79	Besides works
80	whose copyright has expired ,
81	there is an increasing number of modern books
82	available under Creative Commons and similar licenses .
83	You mentioned Larry Lessig 's Free Culture ,
84	but it also includes some out of print titles by publishers
85	who are open to the concept , such as O'Reilly .
86	Do you want to limit the scope of LibriVox strictly to old public domain works ,
87	or do you have plans
88	to include recent works under reasonably permissive licenses as well ?
89	We are only doing public domain works , for a number of reasons ,
90	partly to keep simplicity in our copyright situation --
91	public domain means it s as simple
92	as can be .
93	CC makes things more complex .
94	Also , there are other sites , notably podiobooks.com ,
95	which are better suited to CC works than LibriVox .
96	we find
97	it makes things clear and easy to say :
98	published works , public domain , and leave it at that .
99	As far as I can tell ,
100	podiobooks.com features " free as in beer " content â€”
101	material
102	which you can download ,
103	but which is n't under a free content license .
PublicDomain{=2}FreeContentName
104	Instead of " public domain " , would n't " free content " work just as well ,
105	using something like the Free Content Definition
106	to limit the scope ?
107	This needs more discussion obviously :
108	we chose public domain
109	because the texts
110	we use
111	are public domain
112	and we did n't want to add new restrictions , especially not non-commercial ,
113	since already our recordings are being used for a number of commercialish projects
114	( I ca n't recall any specific project names ,
115	but some pay - education sites use LV stuff ) .
116	That 's good and well and fine with us .
117	We do n't want to have to give anyone permission
118	to use our recordings ,
119	we want anyone to use them for whatever they want .
120	Also , for the thing to work
121	you need to have many dedicated volunteers
122	willing to do the management
123	( onerous )
124	and many willing to do the reading .
125	While Pride and Prejudice will attract many readers ,
126	I do n't know about O'Reilly 's latest tome on XML ...
127	though I might be wrong .
