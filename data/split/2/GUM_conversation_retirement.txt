2	that it — it really surprises me .
3	Well she 's begun to listen .
4	Yes she has .
5	You know .
6	She has .
7	Uh , she used to go over
8	and read a book or something .
9	Yeah ,
10	or turn a deaf ear .
11	That was for sure .
12	But uh , once you understand it ,
13	you know ,

SamRetirement{=2}RegBarrAndDuvall
16	I really ought a call , at least Reg Barr ,
17	and ask
18	if uh , he 's still speaking to me .
19	Well now , he was the one
20	that was up on the left , up there .
21	Yeah .
22	Yeah .
23	Yes .
24	Well , he came over to you all smiles ,
25	I noticed .
26	Yes .
27	Well , we 've known each other for thirty - some years ,
28	why would n't he ?
29	But a- anyway , um , I was so glad
30	that he opened up on this disclosure bit .
31	Because it was Burns that 's been objecting to our having it .
32	Oh ?
33	And I knew this .
34	So when he opened up on that ,
35	and she followed through ,
36	and told about her husband ,
37	you know ?
38	Not necessarily that she would approve of it ,
39	but at least she was n't disapproving .
40	Yeah .
41	Of it .
42	Yeah .
43	And uh , course Duvall might –
44	And I – I can not get over this .
45	That man .
46	I really can not .
47	And you know ,
48	he must have been thinking ,
49	when he said
50	he was n't a political appointee ,
51	he must have been associating his relationship with Steitler .
52	Oh .
53	I really do believe that .
54	Mhm .
55	In his thinking .
56	I do n't know
57	how else he could have done it .
58	That topples over .
59	Um , but he did n't say that .
60	Oh ?
61	He said ,
62	I loved your hum- humor , uh ,
63	and I love you ,
64	but , I am not a political appointee .
65	And his eyes were just snapping .
66	And I said ,
67	Oh ?
68	How did you get on the board ?
69	Well he said ,
70	I got a letter from the governor ,
71	asking .
72	Everybody on there is an app- political appointee ,
73	that was n't the point .
74	The point was ,
75	I could have mentioned what was in the paper about him ,
76	that he was related
77	and ,
78	you know ,
79	had business with Steitler ,
80	and I just said ,
81	and there 's Doctor Duvall ,
82	you know ?
83	And then I went to Rotus ,
84	who 's a seasoned politician ,
85	if there ever was one .
86	Yeah .
87	He just would flare .
88	And I said ,
89	well , I –
90	alright .
91	I said ,
92	I 'll apologize next time ,
93	and I 'm gon na make hay out of it ,
94	do n't you worry .
95	I wan na know
96	how you birds got on that board ,
97	if you 're not political appointees .
98	Mm .
99	Oh my .
