ŁódźIntro{>1}CityDetails
6	Unlike most other large Polish cities ,
7	which have long histories ,
8	Łódź was created almost from scratch during the 19th century textile industry boom
9	to house textile mills , their owners and their workers ,
10	and rapidly grew
11	to become an important industrial and commerce centre .
12	In recent years , Łódź has been battling rising unemployment and youth migration
13	resulting from the failing textile industry
14	and is repositioning itself as a hub for design and creative industries .
15	Owing to its history ,
16	Łódź has an impressive collection of residential , commercial and industrial 19th - century architecture including some of Europe 's largest factory buildings ,
17	now mostly repurposed as shopping centres or lofts .
18	Recent local investment and a long - standing cultural scene ensures there is always something more
19	to do
20	than just sightseeing
21	or shopping ,
22	with the city hosting some of the best museums and art galleries in the country .
23	The close proximity of Warsaw and Łódź 's location at the crossroads of the Polish motorway system make it an ideal destination for a day trip or longer city break .

26	Name and history
27	The origin of the city 's name is unknown ,
28	however , the word łódź translates to " boat " in English .
29	This is referred to in the emblem
30	and when you hear the dwellers of Łódź
31	( łodzianin
32	( man )
33	łodzianka
34	( woman )
35	łodzianie
36	( plural ) )
37	calling themselves " the boat people " .
38	A settlement on the area of present - day Łódź was established in the 14th century
39	and in 1423 it was granted a town charter , along with the right to have a marketplace .
40	However , the real development of Łódź started with the industrial era at the beginning of the 19th century
41	when the city was chosen to be the heart of the rapidly - growing textile industry .
42	The population of Łódź soared from some 4,000 people in the 1830s
43	and 40,000 in 1865
44	to over 300,000 inhabitants at the turn of the century ,
45	which was an unprecedented growth on a worldwide scale .
46	The rapid development of Łódź in the second half of the 19th century was brought about by the rise of enormous industrialist fortunes .
47	New inhabitants , craftsmen and merchants came to Łódź ;
48	markets and town fairs came to life .
49	The profits obtained from prosperous textile mills opened up practically unlimited possibilities for their owners .
50	The city residences became expressions of the riches and power of the local tycoons .
51	They were usually situated next to the owner 's factory .
52	Ever since the industrial revolution brought a massive influx of workforce ,
53	Łódź had been a city almost equally divided between four cultures -
54	Polish , Jewish , German and Russian .
55	The day before the outbreak of World War II , Łódź was inhabited by approximately 672,000 people ,
56	among whom 35 % were of Jewish faith
57	and some 15 % were ethnic German .
58	Andrzej Wajda 's movie , Promised Land
59	based on a novel by the Nobel laureate Władysław Reymont ,
60	depicts those times
61	and is a worthwhile introduction to the city 's bustling history .
62	During the Nazi occupation , Łódź was incorporated directly into the Third Reich .
63	The city was renamed to Litzmannstadt ,
64	and Piotrkowska Street was called Adolf - Hitler - Strasse .
65	The Jewish community was practically wiped out ,
66	and many others lost their lives .
67	Although the city was not destroyed in the aftermath ,
68	the material losses were serious
69	as the machinery , raw materials and finished goods were taken away by the fleeing Nazis .
70	The day before the liberation , about 80,000 Germans left Łódź in panic .
71	At the beginning of 1945 , the population was estimated at 300,000 .

ŁódźHistoryAndOverview{=2}ŁódźToday
73	Łódź today
74	Since the fall of communism in Poland , Łódź has not enjoyed the rapid economic growth
75	cities like Kraków , Warsaw and Wrocław have experienced ,
76	and has had to endure the fall of much of its textile industry , rising unemployment and emigration
77	( within Poland and abroad ) .
78	This led to further dilapidation of the investment - starved city ,
79	and many of its streets and buildings show profound signs of neglect .
80	At first glance , for a city of 760,000 and agglomeration of 1.428,000 , there does not seem to be much
81	to see .
82	However , the situation is rapidly changing now
83	with Łódź campaigning
84	and redesigning itself as an up - and - coming destination .
85	To accomplish this ,
86	Łódź has been capitalizing on its film history -
87	Łódź is jokingly referred to as the " HollyŁódź " of Poland
88	and hosts several film festivals and many other cultural events .
89	Łódź today may not have the glitz and glamour of its heyday ;
90	however , there is a certain charm to Łódź in its partially renovated façades and leitmotivs ,
91	not to mention its grand artistic traditions .
