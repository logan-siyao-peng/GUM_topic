10	and receives an average of 40 inches of precipitation each year ,
11	both of which account for its abundant beautiful rolling green terrain .
12	As a result , Tulsa breaks the Oklahoma stereotype of being nothing but a flat , arid dust bowl .
13	Summers can be very warm
14	and with the cold wind across the plains it can get very cold in the winter ,
15	but it does not last long .
16	The winters are considered to be very mild .
17	There is not much snow ,
18	just a few inches each year , typically ,
19	although in 2007 and again in 2008 there were rather large " ice storms " .

26	having been a booming city during the 1920s
27	when the architecture was first built by rich oil barons
28	who built stately mansions

69	Get around
70	Thanks to urban planning , the major city streets are placed in a grid layout .
71	Almost all major intersections are one mile from each other , and exactly in a straight line .
72	That makes it much easier to find places than in cities
73	where streets go every which way .
74	The major exception is downtown ,
75	which is slanted at almost a 45 degree angle to the rest of the grid .
76	By car
77	Several freeways and bypasses can be used
78	to easily get around the Tulsa Metro area :
79	I - 244 , I - 44 , US 169
80	( Mingo Valley Expressway ,
81	aka " Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway " ) ,
82	US 75 , Hwy 51
83	( Broken Arrow Expressway , The " B.A. " ) ,
84	Creek Turnpike .
85	The streets and avenues are planned on a 1 mile by 1 mile grid system ,
86	with the main arterials running on each mile .
87	In the core of the city , named avenues run north / south
88	and are named after US cities , generally in repeating alphabetical order
89	( for example , Winston - Yale - Allegheny - Braden ) .
90	In the mid-town area the names are taken from colleges and college towns .
91	North / South is divided by Admiral Blvd .
92	Name streets East of Main are cities east of the Mississippi River ,
93	vice versa for name streets west of Main .
94	In the parts of the city farther from downtown , north - south streets are numbered .
95	It is important to recognize that the specific format of the north - south numbered street names is North / South 145th East / West Avenue .
96	Numbered streets run East / West with Main Street and the Arkansas River as the dividing line .
97	Watch out for Place , Street , Avenue designation , e.g. 47th Place , 47th Street , or Florence Place , Florence Avenue .
98	It is important to recognize that the specific format of the east - west numbered street names is West / East 71st Street North / South .
99	In some parts of the city , numbered streets intersect ,
100	so the distinction is important .
101	Although rare ,
102	one east - west numbered street may even intersect with a street of the same number
103	running north - south .
104	Downtown streets were originally platted parallel to the Frisco railroad tracks .
105	When Tulsa expanded beyond the bounds of its original plat ,
106	the expanded areas were platted in alignment with the points of the compass .
107	Thus the " twisted " area down - town represents the original extent of Tulsa ca 1907 .
108	By bus
109	Tulsa Transit provides bus service for the Tulsa Metro area .
110	Cities served are Tulsa , Sand Springs , Sapulpa , Jenks , and Broken Arrow .

112	( downtown ) .
113	They do not run that often , especially to the outer towns like Broken Arrow .
114	Unlike major cities in the Northeast , the city bus is not a major form of transportation in the city .
115	It is usually a means of travel for those
116	who are without their own motor vehicle .
117	By bicycle
118	Tulsa has an extensive interconnected paved bike trail system .
119	Rivertrail follows the Arkansas River from downtown Tulsa south to the suburbs .
120	The Katy Trail runs west to Sand Springs .
121	The Osage Trail is a rails - to - trails route
122	that begins at the OSU - Tulsa campus and travels north 15 miles to Skiatook .
123	The Creek Trail connects Rivertrail
124	and continues east through Broken Arrow to the NSU - Broken Arrow campus .
125	Riders accustomed to flat terrain may find Tulsa 's rolling land to be a bit more challenging , particularly during the heat of summer .
126	If you are looking for a good workout ,
127	the Creek Turnpike Trail follows the land 's original contours .
128	Rivertrail is probably be best choice for the rider
129	seeking an easy route .
