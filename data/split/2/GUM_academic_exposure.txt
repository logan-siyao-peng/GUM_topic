2	Research on adult - learned second language
3	( L2 )
4	has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms
5	underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar
6	[ 1 ] – [ 11 ] .
7	Of interest here , studies suggest
8	that ,
9	despite the difficulties
10	in acquiring L2 grammar ,
11	adult learners can approximate native - like levels of use and neurocognitive processing
12	[ 12 ] – [ 15 ] .
13	However , it is not enough to have attained such native - like levels .
14	Crucially , it is also desirable to retain them , even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2 .
15	In fact , substantial periods
16	( months to years )
17	of limited or no exposure
18	following L2 training
19	are not uncommon ,
20	and may even be the norm
21	[ 16 ] .
22	Such a scenario may be found in different situations ,
23	including when one studies a language in a classroom
24	and then stops taking classes
25	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ]
26	and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting
27	and then moves away
28	[ 19 ] .
29	In the present study , we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar :
30	that is , whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / or less native - like neural processes
31	( “ use it
32	or lose it ”
33	[ 20 ] ) ,
34	no such changes ,
35	or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / or more native - like processing may be observed .
36	Additionally , we test
37	whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training , in particular between classroom - like and immersion - like contexts .

39	We are aware of six studies
40	designed
41	to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure
42	following adult L2 training
43	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] ,
44	all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral
45	( performance )
46	outcomes .
47	( Note
48	that we do not consider case studies , purely observational data , or research on L2s
49	acquired by children ;
50	for a comprehensive review , see [ 16 ] ) .
51	The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills
52	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] ,
53	though also on more specific paradigms
54	meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities
55	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ]
56	or lexical abilities
57	[ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
58	These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects
59	who had not experienced a period of limited exposure
60	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] ,
61	or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects
62	[ 21 ] ,
63	with only one longitudinal study
64	testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure
65	[ 24 ] .
66	Across the studies , the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training
67	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ]
68	or mixed classroom and immersion training
69	[ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
70	The training lasted varying lengths of time , apparently usually in the range of a few years ,
71	and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels
72	( though not directly measured , except by [ 24 ] )
73	prior to the period of limited exposure .
74	Overall , the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following .
75	A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition
76	( loss )
77	of L2 performance or knowledge
78	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .
79	Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month
80	[ 23 ]
81	or 6 month delay
82	[ 21 ] ,
83	as well as after 2 years
84	[ 18 ] ,
85	though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years , and not earlier
86	[ 17 ] .
87	Although attrition may take place within the first few years ,
88	some studies suggest
89	that it then appears to level off ,
90	with no further losses occurring
91	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
92	Higher levels of proficiency
93	( or exposure )
94	may be associated with less attrition
95	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ]
96	or even with no observed losses
97	[ 21 ] .
98	Moreover , one study found no changes at all in performance , across proficiency levels , after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure
99	[ 22 ] .
100	Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed :
101	after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training
102	[ 24 ] ,
103	and in another study after 2 years ,
104	though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension
105	[ 18 ] .
106	It remains unclear what might explain such gains ,
107	which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure
108	[ 24 ] ,
109	or to factors
110	related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training
111	[ 18 ] .
