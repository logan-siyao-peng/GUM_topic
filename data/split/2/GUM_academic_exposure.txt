2	Research on adult - learned second language
3	( L2 )
4	has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms
5	underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar
6	[ 1 ] – [ 11 ] .
7	Of interest here , studies suggest
8	that ,
9	despite the difficulties
10	in acquiring L2 grammar ,
11	adult learners can approximate native - like levels of use and neurocognitive processing
12	[ 12 ] – [ 15 ] .
13	However , it is not enough to have attained such native - like levels .
14	Crucially , it is also desirable to retain them , even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2 .
15	In fact , substantial periods
16	( months to years )
17	of limited or no exposure
18	following L2 training
19	are not uncommon ,
20	and may even be the norm
21	[ 16 ] .
22	Such a scenario may be found in different situations ,
23	including when one studies a language in a classroom
24	and then stops taking classes
25	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ]
26	and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting
27	and then moves away
28	[ 19 ] .
29	In the present study , we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar :
30	that is , whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / or less native - like neural processes
31	( “ use it
32	or lose it ”
33	[ 20 ] ) ,
34	no such changes ,
35	or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / or more native - like processing may be observed .
36	Additionally , we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training , in particular between classroom - like and immersion - like contexts .

38	We are aware of six studies
39	designed
40	to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure
41	following adult L2 training
42	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] ,
43	all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral
44	( performance )
45	outcomes .
46	( Note
47	that we do not consider case studies , purely observational data , or research on L2s
48	acquired by children ;
49	for a comprehensive review , see [ 16 ] ) .
50	The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills
51	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] ,
52	though also on more specific paradigms
53	meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities
54	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ]
55	or lexical abilities
56	[ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
57	These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects
58	who had not experienced a period of limited exposure
59	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] ,
60	or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects
61	[ 21 ] ,
62	with only one longitudinal study
63	testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure
64	[ 24 ] .
65	Across the studies , the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training
66	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ]
67	or mixed classroom and immersion training
68	[ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
69	The training lasted varying lengths of time , apparently usually in the range of a few years ,
70	and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels
71	( though not directly measured , except by [ 24 ] )
72	prior to the period of limited exposure .
73	Overall , the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following .
74	A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition
75	( loss )
76	of L2 performance or knowledge
77	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .
78	Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month
79	[ 23 ]
80	or 6 month delay
81	[ 21 ] ,
82	as well as after 2 years
83	[ 18 ] ,
84	though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years , and not earlier
85	[ 17 ] .
86	Although attrition may take place within the first few years ,
87	some studies suggest
88	that it then appears to level off ,
89	with no further losses occurring
90	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
91	Higher levels of proficiency
92	( or exposure )
93	may be associated with less attrition
94	[ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ]
95	or even with no observed losses
96	[ 21 ] .
97	Moreover , one study found no changes at all in performance , across proficiency levels , after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure
98	[ 22 ] .
99	Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed :
100	after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training
101	[ 24 ] ,
102	and in another study after 2 years ,
103	though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension
104	[ 18 ] .
105	It remains unclear what might explain such gains ,
106	which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure
107	[ 24 ] ,
108	or to factors
109	related to general maturation , cognitive development , or continued academic training
110	[ 18 ] .
