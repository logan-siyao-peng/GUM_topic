1	The day
2	it rained in the garden
3	The first drops of rain fell onto the parched stones from a cloudless blue sky .
4	They disappeared immediately ,
5	drunk down into the mineral silence .
FirstSignsItWillRain{<2}EveryoneWaiting
6	The garden paused ,
7	and everything held its breath
8	and waited .
9	More rain would come .
10	Everyone knew , beyond belief or necessity
11	that the time had come .
12	And with it , the rain .
13	Heavy oily drops bounced from leaf to grass to dusty ground ,
14	gathering in stems and folds on the way .
15	Yet still the sky was a hard polished blue with not a cloud in sight .
16	Still the garden held its breath .
17	It would not be long now .
18	A spattering of drops plucked memories from deep in the roots ,
19	shivering through shoots and tendrils , humus and stone .
20	Wispy vapour trails marbled the blue surface above .

21	And then it rained for good .
22	We sat on the porch
23	watching ,
24	no longer daring to dart out and leap around in the downfall
25	as drops turned to torrents
26	and the staccato tapping on the roof climaxed to a thunderous roar .
27	Pools erupted
28	and overflowed along the edges of the lawn ,
29	cascading around the raspberry canes and over the flower beds .
30	Earthworms rose up from the water - laden earth
31	where they could no longer breath
32	and wriggled
33	and struggled fro air on the surface ,
34	writhing
35	and swimming for a safe haven .
36	Water burst over the barrels and cans
37	standing under the eaves and gutters ,
38	flooding the pathways ,
39	carrying away all
40	that was n’t fixed solid
41	and licking at the stairs to the back porch
42	before climbing each step
43	and lapping against the planks
44	we were sitting on ,
45	a wooden raft
46	surrounded by angry water and martial beat
47	drum , drum , drumming on the roof above .
48	We slipped out feet over the sides
49	and
50	when we felt the fish ,
51	some as big as logs ,
52	some as small as leaves ,
53	nibble at our feet ,
54	we leant over
55	to watch them fraying and frolicking under the choppy surface .
56	Waves lapped at the porch ,
57	washing away the boxes , and bowls , and the dog ’s basket .
58	The rocking chair , the watering can , boxes of cuttings , and tied - up newspapers , all floated away
59	as we slammed the kitchen door shut
60	and retreated to the front room
61	we gazed out at the river
62	that the street had become .
63	The sky was pewter
64	smeared with charcoal now ,
65	and pressed down hard on the rooftops ,
66	slowly dissolving everything below .
67	When the water rippled into the hallway ,
68	we splashed our way to the staircase and then up
69	as it nipped at our heels .

70	Outside the other houses were rocks
71	surrounded by sea
72	with mermaids swimming all around ,
73	flapping their scaly tails
74	and hauling themselves up ,
75	to fall backwards into the crest of the oncoming waves .
76	And as they swam
77	they sang ,
78	their voices born on the winds and the salt and the rain ,
79	and we could hear them singing ,
80	He is coming ,
81	He is coming .
82	And they combed their long hair in preparation .
83	We waved
84	and called ,
85	and they laughed
86	and played ,
87	tantalising ,
88	their seaweed locks just out of reach .
89	With a flick of the tail they were off ,
90	still singing ,
91	He is coming ,
92	He is coming ,
93	until their voices were lost in the noise of the rain and the water .
94	A great whiskered head arose ,
95	then a belly ,
96	wet
97	and sleek ,
98	long enough
99	to wrap itself twice around the world .
100	“ Is it him ? ”
101	we asked each other ,
102	nudging elbows
103	and climbing onto the chairs .
104	We pulled off wet socks and shoes ,
105	letting them float away on the tide ,
106	before the great worm turned
107	and the wake engulfed the creaking , cracking house .
108	We clambered up onto the roof ,
109	sliding on the tiles
110	and clinging to chimney stacks ,
111	sheltering our eyes from the driving downpour .
112	The sky was black ,
113	and the stormy sea all the deepest , darkest blues and greens and greys
114	and flecked with white
115	where the sea - horses galloped .
116	The waters broke
117	making way for the gnarled head of a whale ,
118	spouting water high against the clouds
119	before opening its whiskered maw
120	and in a looming , booming voice called :
121	He is coming ,
122	He is coming .
123	The chimneys washed away ,
124	so we scrambled onto the blue - black back
125	encrusted with barnacles and cockles like stars in a night sky
126	and held on tight
127	as he rode the waves ,
128	dipping
129	and blowing ,
130	dipping
131	and blowing .
132	The wind and the rain tugged at our hair .
133	And still it rained .
134	We heard a fearsome creaking and cracking
135	and before our eyes a great patch of sky peeled away ,
136	deeping down in the troughs
137	and riding the crests
138	with torn sails set against the wind .
139	It was a galleon with masts like a dead man ’s fingers ,
140	tarred timbers groaning
141	and a mermaid sat on the bow
142	as he ship dipped
143	and passed .
144	He is coming ,
145	He is coming ,
146	she sang out .
147	And just as the wash hit us ,
148	prising us from the whale ’s speckled back and down into the sea ,
149	someone threw down a knotted rope
150	and we hung on for dear life .
151	The singing sailors hauled us aboard
152	chanting ,
153	He ’s a coming - ha !
154	He ’s a coming - ha !
155	And we fell onto the deck
156	like fish bursting from a net .
157	The Captain stood above us
158	dressed in jewels and finery from a thousand pillagings .
