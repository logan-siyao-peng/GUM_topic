1	Respect
2	Thais are a polite people
3	and ,
4	while remarkably tolerant of foreigners gallivanting on their beaches and with their women ,
5	you ll find
6	that you will get more respect
7	if you in turn treat them and their customs with respect .
8	The wai

11	The traditional greeting
12	known as the wai ,
13	where you press your hands together
14	as is in prayer
15	and bow slightly ,
16	is derived from the Hindu cultural influence from India ,
17	and still widely practised .
18	Among Thais , there are strict rules of hierarchy
19	that dictate how and when the wai should be given .
20	In brief , inferiors salute superiors first .
21	You should not wai service people or street vendors .
22	The higher your hands go ,
23	the more respectful you are .
24	You will also often see
25	Thais doing a wai
26	as they walk past temples and spirit houses .
27	As a foreign visitor , you are not expected to know how to wai ,
28	nor to reciprocate
29	when wai'd to ;
30	while you 're unlikely to cause offense
31	if you do ,
32	you may well look slightly strange .
33	If somebody makes a wai to you ,
34	a slight bow alone is more than sufficient for ordinary occasions ,
35	and for business , most Thais will shake hands with foreigners instead of waiing anyway .
Respect{=1}DressAndReligion
36	Dress
37	Personal appearance is very important in Thailand as a measure of respect to other people .
38	You will find
39	that dressing appropriately means that you are shown more respect in return .
40	This translates in many ways ,
41	even sometimes lowering initial offering prices at markets .
42	While some allowance is made for the differing customs of foreigners ,
43	Thais respond more positively to well - dressed Westerners .
44	Traditionally , Thais are modest and conservative dressers .
45	At a minimum your clothes should be neat , clean , and free from holes or tears .
46	Except at the beach or at sacred sites normal western dress is acceptable for both men and women ,
47	except that you should avoid clothing
48	showing a lot of skin .
49	Pants are preferable to shorts ,
50	blouses should have capped sleeves ,
51	and
52	if tank tops are worn ,
53	the straps should be thick
54	( i.e. , not spaghetti straps ) .
55	Thai men generally wear pants ,
56	and most Thais view an adult man
57	wearing shorts
58	as fairly ridiculous ;
59	shorts are primarily worn by laborers and schoolchildren .
60	Men 's shorts should be knee length or more ,
61	if worn at all .
62	Taking off one 's shoes at temples and private homes is mandatory etiquette ,
63	and this may even be requested at some shops .
64	Wear shoes
65	that slip on and off easily .
66	Flip - flops , hiking sandals , and clog - type shoes are usually a good pragmatic choice
67	for traveling in Thailand ;
68	only in the most top - end establishments are shoes required .
69	It is best to play it safe with wats and other sacred sites in Thailand ;
70	your dress should be unambiguously modest and cover your entire torso and most of your limbs .
71	For men , ankle - length pants are mandatory ;
72	on top , t - shirts are acceptable ,
73	though a button - front or polo shirt would be best .
74	Many recommend
75	that women wear only full length dresses and skirts ;
76	you should make sure that your clothing covers at least your shoulders and your knees
77	and some places may require that you wear ankle - length pants or skirts and long sleeved tops .
78	Shorts and sleeveless shirts are highly inappropriate ,
79	as are short skirts .
80	The rules are even more strict for foreign visitors ,
81	so
82	even if you see a local in shorts
83	it 's not OK for everyone .
84	Topless sunbathing is common by Western women at many tourist beaches .
85	At beaches which are primarily Thai visitors however ,
86	this is not advised .

89	Monks are an integral part of Buddhism in Thailand ,
90	and Thai men are generally expected to spend a certain amount of time
91	living as a monk
92	at least once in their lifetime .
93	Buddhist monks are meant to avoid sexual temptations ,
94	and in particular they do not touch women
95	or take things from women 's hands .
96	Women should make every effort to make way for monks on the street and give them room
97	so they do not have to make contact with you .
98	Women should avoid offering anything to a monk with their hands .
99	Objects or donations should be placed in front of a monk
100	so he can pick it up ,
101	or place it on a special cloth
102	he carries with him .
103	Monks will sometimes be aided by a layman
104	who will accept things from women merit - makers on their behalf .
105	Theravada Buddhist monks are also supposed to avoid material temptations
106	and as such , are not allowed to touch money ,
107	so offering money to a monk is considered to be a sign of disrespect in most Theravada Buddhist cultures .
108	Therefore ,
109	should you wish to donate to a monk ,
110	you should only offer food , and put your monetary donation in the appropriate donation box at the temple .
111	Those monks
112	that accept money
113	are almost always fakes .
