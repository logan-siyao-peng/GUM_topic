1	Sam has been , has taken such an interest in this retirement bit
2	that it — it really surprises me .
3	Well she 's begun to listen .
4	Yes she has .
5	You know .
6	She has .
7	Uh , she used to go over
8	and read a book
9	or something .
10	Yeah ,
11	or turn a deaf ear .
12	That was for sure .
13	But uh , once you understand it ,
14	you know ,
15	you , you 're interested in getting right in , and going after it .
16	Yeah .
17	I really ought a call , at least Reg Barr ,
18	and ask
19	if uh , he 's still speaking to me .
20	Well now , he was the one
21	that was up on the left , up there .
22	Yeah .
23	Yeah .
24	Yes .
25	Well , he came over to you all smiles ,
26	I noticed .
27	Yes .
28	Well , we 've known each other for thirty - some years ,
29	why would n't he ?
30	But a- anyway , um , I was so glad
31	that he opened up on this disclosure bit .
32	Because it was Burns that 's been objecting to our having it .
33	Oh ?
34	And I knew this .
35	So when he opened up on that ,
36	and she followed through ,
37	and told about her husband ,
38	you know ?
39	Not necessarily that she would approve of it ,
40	but at least she was n't disapproving .
41	Yeah .
42	Of it .
43	Yeah .
44	And uh , course Duvall might –
45	And I – I can not get over this .
46	That man .
47	I really can not .
48	And you know ,
49	he must have been thinking ,
50	when he said
51	he was n't a political appointee ,
52	he must have been associating his relationship with Steitler .
53	Oh .
54	I really do believe that .
55	Mhm .
56	In his thinking .
57	I do n't know
58	how else he could have done it .
59	That topples over .
60	Um , but he did n't say that .
61	Oh ?
62	He said ,
63	I loved your hum- humor , uh ,
64	and I love you ,
65	but , I am not a political appointee .
66	And his eyes were just snapping .
67	And I said ,
68	Oh ?
69	How did you get on the board ?
70	Well he said ,
71	I got a letter from the governor ,
72	asking .
73	Everybody on there is an app- political appointee ,
74	that was n't the point .
75	The point was ,
76	I could have mentioned what was in the paper about him ,
77	that he was related
78	and ,
79	you know ,
80	had business with Steitler ,
81	and I just said ,
82	and there 's Doctor Duvall ,
83	you know ?
84	And then I went to Rotus ,
85	who 's a seasoned politician ,
86	if there ever was one .
87	Yeah .
88	He just would flare .
89	And I said ,
90	well , I –
91	alright .
92	I said ,
93	I 'll apologize next time ,
94	and I 'm gon na make hay out of it ,
95	do n't you worry .
96	I wan na know
97	how you birds got on that board ,
98	if you 're not political appointees .
99	Mm .
100	Oh my .
