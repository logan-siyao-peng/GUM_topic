1	Does n’t it make you just want to sneeze ?
2	Pete was leaning against the wall ,
3	watching the street go by .
4	I pulled the bike to a halt ,
5	the front wheel pointing in his direction .
6	“ I think
7	I ’ve got a fairy stuck up my nose . ”
8	“ S’ not true ! ”
9	came a voice from inside the nose in question .
10	“ Hey ! Not bad that ! ”
11	Pete said .
12	“ I did n’t see your lips move at all . ”
13	“ It ’s not a joke . ”
14	The itching was getting worse .
15	I pulled out a paper tissue .
16	“ Stop that now ! ”
17	came the voice again .
18	“ You know
19	I do n’t like it . ”
20	“ S’ not my fault .
21	You make me want to sneeze ! ”
22	And I did .
23	I inspected the crumpled paper .
24	Lots of yellow goo ,
25	but no fairy .
26	Pete looked at me with mild disgust
27	as I eyed the handkerchief more closely .
28	“ You know that ’s pretty gross … ”
29	he said .
30	“ Got any other brilliant remarks ? ”
31	I said .
32	I held a finger up to my lips ,
33	and waved a hand
34	to silence Pete ’s reply .
35	“ Are you still there ? ”
36	I called .
37	“ No thanks to you ! ”
38	came the little voice .
39	Pete looked at me sort of sideways .
40	“ Look , the first time was OK ,
41	but — ”
42	“ It ’s not a joke .
43	I ’ve really got something stuck up there .
44	I was riding on me bike
45	and I thought
46	I ’d swallowed an insect or something .
47	And then it started insulting me . ”
48	“ You ’re having me on , right ? ”
49	“ Pete !
50	Look at me .
51	If it ’s a trick ,
52	how do I do it then ? ”
53	Pete thought for a moment .
54	“ If it ’s real …
55	Are n’t they supposed to have a pot of gold or something ?
56	And they have to tell you where it is
57	if you catch them ? ”
58	“ That ’s leprechauns , idiot ! ”
59	said the voice from my noise .
60	“ So what ’s the difference ?
61	Just give us the gold
62	and we ’ll let you go … ”
63	“ We — ? ”
64	I started .
65	He winked at me .
66	“ Oh , I ’m happy to stick around , ”
67	came the voice .
68	“ It ’s noggins here who wants to get rid of me … ”
69	Suddenly I felt a violent pain in my nose ,
70	my eyes watered .
71	“ Owwww ! ”
72	I howled .
73	“ See what I mean ? ”
74	the voice shouted over my moans .
75	“ Perhaps you can use it in exams … ”
76	Pete said ,
77	scratching his head .
78	“ You know ,
79	it could tell us all the answers . ”
80	“ Idiot !
81	If it yacks on like that in an exam ,
82	I ’ll get thrown out .
83	And probably locked up too . ”
84	“ Ca n’t it whisper ? ”
85	“ Perhaps I do n’t know the answers anyway ? ”
86	said the voice .
87	“ Have you thought of that ? ”
88	“ Anyway , I do n’t want it in exams .
89	I just want it to go .
90	Out of my nose . ”
91	“ Ca n’t you just poke it out ? ”
92	“ With what ? ”
93	“ S’pose you ’ve already tried your finger … ”
94	“ Yes he has , ”
95	the voice said .
96	“ And it was n’t pleasant
97	I can tell you . ”
98	“ You see what it ’s like .
99	He ’s already making sarcastic remarks like that … ”
100	“ What if we put something in your nose
101	to catch it ,
102	then ?
103	I do n’t know …
104	A spider ? ”
105	“ No ! ”
106	we both said at once .
107	“ Snap ! ”
108	Pete said .
109	“ You both said the same thing at the same time ,
110	you ’ve got to make a — ”
111	He hit his forehead with his palm .
112	“ That ’s it !
113	Three wishes !
114	When you catch a fairy ,
115	you get three wishes .
116	Hey you in there !
117	Is that right ? ”
118	“ You could see things like that … ”
119	said the voice with resignation .
120	“ I wish you ’d get out of my nose , then ! ”
121	I cried .
122	In a flash the fairy was out of my nose and gone .
123	And I ’m still waiting for my two other wishes .
124	THE END
Story{>1}MessageFromAuthor
125	Something a little lighter this week ,
126	I hope you enjoy it .
127	Once it got started ,
128	I realised
129	that the idea must have been inspired by the title of Justine Larbalestier ’s How to Ditch Your Fairy ,
130	although it has nothing at all to do with that story at all .
131	All in all , my story feels very light .
132	But I think
133	I needed something a little less dark ,
134	and there are some quite sombre tales coming up in the coming weeks .
135	See you then .
