27	I was basically hauled in
28	and told
29	that my mum had attacked the church
30	and that I needed to disconnect from her
31	because she was suppressive .
32	Her mother had spoken out against Scientology on French television
33	after her ex-husband and Paris 's father , Albert Jaquier , committed suicide
34	after he lost his fortune to Scientology .
35	Paris claims
36	that she was kept at Flag Land Base in Clearwater , Florida
37	until she was eighteen
38	and then transferred to the Freewinds .
39	On board the Freewinds ,
40	Paris claims
41	that she was working from 6:00am to midnight
42	and due to lack of sleep ended up being a walking zombie .
43	She also claims
44	that in 1997 and 1998 , she was tasked with removal of asbestos from the ship .
45	In 2007 , Paris left the ship after a confrontation with the ship 's management .
46	She was eventually sent to Rehabilitation Project Force in Sydney ,
47	which the Church describes as a religious retreat ,
48	but critics charge is a forced work camp .
49	Here , she met her future husband
50	and subsequently left the church .
51	In a statement to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , the Church denied these allegations :
52	She certainly was n't ' forced ' to be there .
53	She was also never forced to perform labour in the engine room .
54	They also claimed
55	Paris was a volunteer
56	and claim
57	she has a vested interest for misrepresenting her experiences with the Church .

59	that Paris not having her passport was maritime procedure .
