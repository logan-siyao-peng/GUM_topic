1	So you do n't need to go borrow equipment from anybody ,
2	to to do the feet ?
3	Do the hooves ?
4	Well , we 're gon na have to find somewhere ,
5	to get , something
6	So , Mae -

8	Mae Lynne
9	We 're not gon na do the feet today ,
10	I 'm gon na wait till like , early in the morning ,
11	to do those ,
12	cause y-
13	I mean
14	you get so tired .
15	N- you just ,
16	it takes well ,
17	it takes me longer
18	than most people ,
19	cause
20	you know ,
21	I 'm not as strong
22	and , and I 'm not as good ,
23	as like somebody
24	that would do it all the time .
25	You know .
26	I mean ,
27	oh I mean
28	I trim horses , and stuff like that ,
29	but
30	I mean ,
31	I 'm not like ,
32	I 'm not uh , .
33	I do n't know how to say it .
34	But
35	you know ,
36	they do it for a living .
37	You know ,
38	most people
39	that you would get to trim your horse
40	do it all the time .
41	And I 'm not that good or ,
42	and I 'm not very strong .
43	Did they train you —
44	Yeah .
45	Did they train you that —
46	Yeah .
47	Yeah .
48	So you have your own equipment , but —
49	No .
50	I do n't have my own equipment at all .
51	Dad ,
52	you know ,
53	has done some of it .
54	That 's another thing too ,
55	is I kinda had a b- general idea ,
56	of kinda how to do it ,
57	just watching him .
58	Or — and watching , people come to our place ,
59	and doing it
60	and stuff
61	you know .
62	And , I do n't know .
TrimmingHorseNow{<1}SchoolTrimmingAndHorseshoes
63	Then , down there , um , it 's mandatory .
64	You have to —
65	to graduate ,
66	you know ,
67	or well , to get the degree ,
68	you know ,
69	you have to take this class .
70	And you can only take —
71	if you want to ,
72	you can only take it for eight weeks .
73	And ,
74	if you wan na go on in it ,
75	you n- — then , you can go on .
76	You know .
77	And I decided to go ahead
78	and go on in it .
79	And the first part of it , is like ,
80	well we have lecture ,
81	then we have lab .
82	And like , the first part of it , we just go into the classroom ,
83	and he like ...
84	In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work .
85	I mean ,
86	it — that 's just kinda how it happens ,
87	you know ,
88	because he kinda has to tell you ...
89	They go over the whole , the whole part of the horse .
90	I mean ,
91	all the skeleton part of it
92	you know ,
93	and — and they go through every kind a ligament .
94	And
95	I mean ,
96	there 's , millions of ligaments , and millions of tendons ,
97	you know ,
98	well not millions ,
99	but ,
100	I mean ...
101	Yeah , I bet .
102	And then , so we had to know these tendons , and ligaments , and then , all the bones , and ,
103	you know ,
104	all the way up – from the shoulder down , and then from the hip down .
105	You know ,
106	all the way down to the hoof , and then , the bone in the hoof , and , then all the wall , and ,
107	you know ,
108	of the hoof , and , what everything was called there ,
109	and then , he went over on how to trim it , and where you —
110	Th- there 's a white line ,
111	that you go by ,
112	and a horse has this little white line ,
113	and you clean it out with the — with the hoof knife .
114	You know ?
115	And then there —
116	and then you can see this little white line ?
117	And that 's kinda where you go by , to —
118	You know ,
119	the horse kinda helps you out ,
120	because it , has that little white line right there .
121	Mhm .
122	And that 's where you kinda — kinda need a little guide ,
123	of where you trim .
124	And , I am still scared to do it .
125	Because ,
126	you know ,
127	I mean ,
128	you can make a horse go lame ,
129	by doing it .
130	Really ?
131	Well you can trim em too short .
132	And make em ,
133	you know ,
134	and they 're just a little bit , for f- the first couple of days ,
135	you know ,
136	I mean
137	they 're just sore .
138	That 's not bad ,
139	but sometimes you can get it really bad .
140	You can really make a horse really bad .
141	And they m-
142	You know
143	then , they have to , like , keep em , away from anything ,
144	you know ,
145	get em really in the soft ground , and , no hard pebbles , or hard clods of dirt or anything ?
146	So , I do n't know .
147	I 'm a little scared about doing it yet .
148	You know ,
149	I get em really long .
150	I mean
151	they 're still long ,
152	when I get done with them .
153	A lot of times , like , I 'll get done ,
154	and I 'll think
155	I 'm done ,
156	and I 'll look at -
157	look down at the horse 's hoof ,
158	and it 's still ,
159	it 's too long .
160	And then like , I would never , ever , ever , trust myself , to shoe a horse .
161	See
162	we did that too .
163	We did —
164	we did a lot of stuff .
165	We did a lot of stuff with the —
166	like we had the , um , the burners ?
167	You know ,
168	and you 'd put the —
169	you 'd have —
170	you started out with the straight iron ?
171	You know ?
172	And you 'd stick it into the , into the ,
173	you know
174	like , actual blacksmithing .
175	And you 'd put it into the hot coals ,
176	you know ?
177	And then , we 'd —
178	I I – straight bar .
179	And we 'd make it a — a horseshoe out of it ,
180	you know ?
181	But , these shoes we never did put on a horse .
182	We just put the shoes
183	that were already made , on a horse .
184	And that 's as far
185	as we got .
186	I mean ,
187	if you would really get into it ,
188	well as a matter of fact , this is really funny .
189	You know ,
190	there is n't really any girl farriers around anywhere .
191	They 're really —
192	Farrier ?
193	Th – yeah .
194	Farrier is what they 're called .
195	And the m- — the reason
196	they were showing us this at college ,
197	was just , to get us ,
198	to know
199	if our trimmer , and shoer was doing it right ,
200	and — plus the knowledge
201	of knowing the bones and ligaments .
202	Which we , we had it in another class too .
203	We — that was kind of a double thing
204	that , we had in — in another class ,
205	so it was kinda review for us .
206	Well it was a review for some people ,
207	depending on what time of the year you took it .
208	You know .
209	If it was a review
210	or not .
211	But , anyway , um , what was I gon na say ?
212	I forgot what I was think- —
213	You said
214	you never made the horseshoes .
215	Gon na say .
216	But .
217	Well , w- um , when we put em on a horse 's hoof ,
218	all
219	we do ,
220	they 're already made .
221	They 're round .
222	We pick out a size .
223	You know
224	we 'd like look at the horse 's hoof ,
225	and say ,
226	okay , this is a double - aught .
227	This is an aught .
228	This is ,
229	you know .
230	What s- — what size .
231	And double - aught and aught , are the ones
232	that are most popular .
233	For ,
234	you know ,
235	the light horse .
236	You know ,
237	I mean ,
238	you get into the big horses , the — like the Clydesdales , Shires ,
239	that 's a d- — a whole different thing .
240	Or ponies , that 's a whole different thing .
241	But we 're talking just the regular , light horses
242	you know .
