IntroHiguchi{>1}Biography
18	Efforts to become a writer
19	She , her mother , and younger sister made ends meet
20	by doing needlework , washing , and other jobs .
21	In 1892 ,
22	after seeing the success of a classmate , Kaho Tanabe ,
23	who wrote a novel ,
24	Higuchi decided to become a novelist
25	to support her family .
26	Nevertheless , her initial efforts
27	at writing fiction
28	were in the form of a short story , a form
29	to which she would remain true .
30	In 1891 she met her future advisor
31	who would help ,
32	she assumed ,
33	this poet - turned - fiction - writer
34	and connect her with editors :
35	Tosui Nakarai .
36	She fell in love with him right away ,
37	not knowing
38	that , at 31 , he had a reputation as a womanizer .
39	Nor did she realize
40	that he wrote popular literature
41	which aimed to please the general public
42	and in no way wished to be associated with serious literature .
43	Her mentor did not return her passionate ,
44	if discreet ,
45	love for him ,
46	and instead treated her as a younger sister .
47	This failed relationship would become a recurrent theme in Higuchi 's fiction .
48	Eventually , she got the break
49	she was so eager for :
50	her first stories were published in a minor newspaper under her pen name , Ichiyo Higuchi .
51	The stories from this first period
52	( 1892 – 94 )
53	suffered from the excessive influence of Heian poetry .
54	Higuchi felt compelled to demonstrate her classical literary training .
55	The plots were thin ,
56	there was little development of character
57	and they were loaded down by excessive sentiment ,
58	especially when compared to what she was writing concurrently in her diary .
59	But she was developing rapidly .
60	Several of her trademark themes appear ;
61	for example , the triangular relationship among a lonely , beautiful , young woman
62	who has lost her parents ,
63	a handsome man
64	who has abandoned her
65	( and remains in the background ) ,
66	and a lonely and desperate ragamuffin
67	who falls in love with her .
68	Another theme
69	Higuchi repeated
70	was the ambition and cruelty of the Meiji middle class .
71	The story " Umoregi "
72	( " In Obscurity " )
73	signaled Higuchi 's arrival as a professional writer .
74	It was published in the prestigious journal Miyako no Hana in 1892 ,
75	only nine months after she had started writing in earnest .
76	Her work was noticed
77	and she was recognized as a promising new author .
78	Her last years
79	In 1893 , Higuchi , her mother and her sister abandoned their middle class house
80	and , with a grim determination
81	to survive ,
82	moved to a poor neighborhood
83	where they opened a stationery store
84	that before long failed .
85	Their new dwelling was a five - minute walk from Tokyo 's ill - famed red - light district , the Yoshiwara .
86	Her experience
87	living in this neighborhood
88	would provide material for several of her later stories , especially " Takekurabe " ,
89	( literally , " Comparing heights " ;
90	" Child 's Play " in the Robert Lyons Danly translation ;
91	also called " Growing Up " in the Edward Seidensticker translation . )
92	The stories of her mature period
93	( 1894 – 96 )
94	were not only marked by her experience
95	living near the red - light district
96	and greater concern over the plight of women ,
97	but also by the influence of Ihara Saikaku , a 17th - century writer ,
98	whose stories she had recently discovered .
99	His distinctiveness lay in great part in his acceptance of low - life characters as worthwhile literary subjects .
100	What Higuchi added was a special awareness
101	of suffering and sensitivity .
102	To this period belong " Ōtsugomori "
103	( " On the Last Day of the Year " ) ,
104	" Nigorie "
105	( " Troubled Waters " ) ,
106	" Wakare - Michi "
107	( " Separate Ways " ) ,
108	" Jūsan'ya "
109	( " The Thirteenth Night " )
110	and " Takekurabe "
111	( " Child 's Play " ) .
112	The last two are considered her best work .
113	With these last stories her fame spread throughout the Tokyo literary establishment .
114	In her humble home she was visited by other writers , students of poetry , admirers , the curious , critics , and editors
115	requesting her collaboration .
116	But between constant interruptions and frequent headaches , Higuchi stopped writing .
117	As her father and one of her brothers had before her ,
118	she had caught tuberculosis .
119	She died on November 23 , 1896 , at the age of twenty - four .
120	Higuchi 's likeness adorns the Japanese 5000 yen banknote as of fall 2004 ,
121	becoming the third woman
122	to appear on a Japanese banknote ,
123	after Empress Jingū in 1881 and Murasaki Shikibu in 2000 .
124	Her best - known stories have been made into movies .
