1	How to Play Muggle Quidditch
2	In the Harry Potter series
3	written by JK Rowling
4	the main wizarding sport is Quidditch .
5	However you do n't have to have magical powers
6	to play .
7	There are many different ways of playing Quidditch ,
8	but the most commonly used set of rules are those
9	given by the International Quidditch Association
10	( which can be found here ) .
11	In the past Muggle Quidditch has mainly been played at colleges in the US ,
12	but over the last few years there has been a dramatic rise in the number of community teams .
13	Quidditch has also spread outside of America
14	and is now played on 5 continents .
QuidditchIntro{=1}HowToPlay
15	Steps
16	Gather all needed materials and players
17	( see Things
18	You 'll Need
19	section below ) .
20	Know
21	that all players can play
22	while riding a broom .
23	Brooms can be a hindrance however ,
24	so feel free to not use brooms .
25	Place the quaffle and three bludgers in the middle of the field .
26	Ideally the quaffle and bludgers should be slightly deflated
27	so that they are easier to throw and catch .
28	Start the game .
29	Both teams start from the edges
30	and attempt to obtain the quaffle and bludgers .
31	Follow your duty
32	depending what type of player you are :
33	Chasers try to score
34	by throwing the quaffle into one of the three goal hoops .
35	Each score is worth 10 points .
36	Beaters try to peg players with their bludger .
37	If a player is pegged
38	they have to stop what they 're doing and pay a penalty ;
39	i.e. ( drop the quaffle in the case of a chaser )
40	and run back to and touch their goal post
41	or alternatively sit down for 10 seconds .
42	Keepers guard the goal posts at each end
43	and attempt to block chasers ' attempts
44	at scoring .
45	If Keeper is close to their hoops
46	they are safe from being hit by bludgers .
47	Seekers try to tackle the snitch
48	( a person )
49	or obtain an object
50	attached to the snitch
51	such as a sock or flag .
52	You can establish you own rules
53	as to how a player catches the snitch .
54	A common way to play is to make the snitch a person ,
55	and give the snitch a head start
56	to run
57	and hide in defined boundaries .
58	Then the seekers search for the snitch ,
59	and attempt to tag the player .
60	Other methods , such as the method
61	adopted in 2005 ,
62	makes the snitch a tennis ball in a sock ,
63	hanging out of the running shorts of the snitch runner .
64	Regardless of method , the winning seeker wins 30 points for his or her team ,
65	unlike the books ,
66	in which the snitch is worth 150 points .
67	The creators of Muggle Quidditch thought
68	that it was worth too many points
69	so changed the value of the snitch for muggle Quidditch .
70	The snitch , generally a track runner , runs around
71	( usually the boundaries )
72	trying to evade the seekers .
73	The referee should ensure that rules are being followed .
74	They also keep track of the score .
75	Play the game !
76	The object of the game is to score the most points
77	and the game ends
78	when the seeker snatches the snitch .
79	Feel free to alter the game rules .
80	See the Tips section for suggestions .

82	How to Play a Real - Life Game of Quidditch
83	You do n't need flying broomsticks or magic balls
84	to play this version of the game -
85	it 's tailor - made for muggles like us .
86	This video shows a more realistic approach
87	to playing Quidditch .
88	Tips
89	Alternatively the snitch can be a small yellow ball
90	( tennis balls work great )
91	that is hidden
92	before the game starts
93	by a bystander or referee .
94	Establish boundaries
95	and have the seekers look for the snitch .
96	Beaters can try hitting the bludgers around in the air with a shortened hockey sticks or a short bat .
97	They could also use regular - length hockey sticks
98	to hit bludgers
99	( perhaps wiffle balls )
100	on the ground .
101	The simplest way is to just peg players
102	by throwing dodge balls .
103	It may be easier to play
104	without brooms
105	( but also less fun ! ) .
106	Remember that the snitch runner ,
107	if you choose to use one ,
108	is not an actual player in the game ,
109	therefore , not bound by any of the rules .
110	If desired ,
111	the snitch is able to do whatever he or she wants
112	to avoid capture .
113	See How to Be a Snitch in Quidditch for more information .
114	You can play water quidditch in a pool .
115	Almost all the same rules apply .
116	Have someone throw something
117	( the snitch )
118	on a line into the pool at regular intervals .
119	They can even use fake snitches .
120	You can buy authentic looking brooms
121	to make the game more realistic .
122	There is a very large Quidditch community ,
123	have a look at the IQA website
124	to find teams near you .
125	One variation is Quarter Snitch Quidditch .
126	Find a quarter or another small coin .
127	Have both of the teams turn around
128	and have the referee throw it into the grass or pitch
129	while the teams are n't looking .
130	Play
131	while the seekers look for the snitch .
132	Another variation is where the referee places the snitch somewhere in the field
133	( in this case it 's a small ball ) .
134	The seeker has to find the snitch blindfolded ,
135	relying only on the coach 's instructions ,
136	while the game is still on .
137	Warnings
138	Stay hydrated
139	and exercise wisely .
140	A ball flying in the air can hurt .
141	If you 're playing quidditch
142	you 're probably just having fun
143	so play nicely .
