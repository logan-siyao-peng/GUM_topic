1	Are there Moral Facts ?
2	So far , we have covered how evolutionary ethics relates to the question
3	what we ought to do
4	and why we are moral in the first place .
5	A related set of questions about ethics are metaethical questions ,
6	which concern the meaning of moral terms , our ways
7	of gaining knowledge of moral facts ,
8	and the nature of the moral facts .
9	In other words ,
10	apart from thinking about how we ought to live , and where our moral sense comes from ,
11	we can also ask
12	what it means to affirm a particular answer to that question ,
13	how we could come to know the answer ,
14	and whether the answer would be a matter of fact or more like an opinion .
15	Many books and articles in moral philosophy start with the observation
16	that moral judgments seem to be objectively true
17	and the assumption
18	that this is how non-philosophers also think about morality .
19	For example , Michael Smith writes :
20	We seem to think
21	moral questions have correct answers ;
22	that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts ;
23	that moral facts are wholly determined by circumstances ;
24	and that ,
25	by engaging in moral conversation and argument ,
26	we can discover what these objective facts are .
27	( Smith 1994 , 6 )
28	But
29	as we have seen above ,
30	evolutionary theory explains
31	why we would think
32	that moral judgments are objective .
33	The philosopher Michael Ruse takes this
34	to show that the apparent objectivity of morality is something like an “ illusion ”
35	foisted on us by our genes
36	( Ruse [ 1986 ] 1998 , 253 ) .
37	Of course ,
38	even if Ruse is correct ,
39	this does not show that moral judgments are not objective ,
40	but it can make us think
41	whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained ,
42	as many philosophers assume .
43	Ruse has also argued
44	that an evolutionary account of morality suggests
45	that there are no moral facts in the first place .
46	Anything
47	we want to explain about morality
48	can be explained
49	without mentioning moral facts ,
50	or so Ruse argues .
51	If moral facts are explanatorily redundant ,
52	indeed , moral realists
53	( those
54	who believe
55	there are mind - independent , objective facts about morality ,
56	as discussed in Chapter 1 )
57	need to say
58	why we should still suppose
59	that moral facts do exist .
60	Interestingly , Ruse ’s methodological naturalism leads him to embrace a view
61	that goes against the metaphysical naturalist position
62	that moral facts exist .
63	Relatedly , Sharon Street , for example , argues
64	that evolutionary explanations of morality show
65	that moral realism is probably false .
66	The kind of moral realism
67	that Street has in mind
68	is the view
69	that moral properties exist as objective features of the world
70	( to wit , whether stealing is wrong is independent of
71	whether anyone thinks or feels
72	that stealing is wrong ) .
73	Street starts with the premise
74	that our moral judgments are influenced by evolutionary forces .
75	This fact ,
76	Street claims ,
77	gives rise to a dilemma for moral realists
78	concerning the relation of the evolutionary forces
79	that influenced our moral judgments and the moral facts
80	claimed to exist by moral realists .
81	If there is no relation between the evolutionary forces and the moral facts ,
82	then it would be an astonishing coincidence
83	if many of our moral judgments were true .
84	In light of the coincidence , we have no reason
85	to assume
86	that our moral judgments are true
87	— an unpalatable conclusion for realists .
88	Claiming that there is a relation , however , is empirically dubious ,
89	according to Street .
90	Mirroring Ruse ’s claim ,
91	moral facts could be purged from what
92	we assume
93	to exist
94	because they do not perform an important explanatory function .
95	So , we should reject moral realism .
96	Street ’s argument illustrates how evolutionary theory can be used
97	to make a case
98	about which metaethical theories we should adopt .
99	Both Ruse ’s and Street ’s arguments rely on the idea
100	that we should only accept that something exists
101	if it plays an indispensable explanatory role
102	and there are means
103	to resist these arguments .
104	[ 12 ]
105	Both arguments ,
106	as presented here ,
107	rely on the correctness of the evolutionary explanation of morality
108	they convey .
109	In the next section , we turn to the relevance of evolutionary ethics for moral epistemology .
110	E.g. Enoch ( 2010 )
111	Can We have Justified Moral Beliefs ?
112	The evolutionary argument by Sharon Street can also be interpreted as an argument about moral justification and moral knowledge .
113	Suppose
114	that moral realists assume
115	that there is no relation between our moral judgments and the moral facts .
116	It would seem like an incredible coincidence
117	if the realists were right
118	that our moral judgments are nonetheless true .
119	There are just too many possible moral truths and too many ways
120	in which evolution could have “ pushed ” our moral beliefs .
121	Street claims
122	that such a coincidence would be too much to believe .
123	But what is the problem , exactly , with having beliefs
124	that are only coincidentally true ?
125	Depending on how we understand “ coincidence , ”
126	my belief
127	that there is a bird outside my window
128	is coincidentally true
129	because
130	had I looked a little later ,
131	the bird would have flown away already .
132	Accidentally true beliefs do not seem problematic in every case .
133	The question for proponents of Street ’s argument is to show why the evolutionary influence on human moral beliefs makes for a particularly problematic case of coincidence .
134	The philosopher Richard Joyce argues
135	that the problem has to do with the sensitivity of our moral beliefs to the moral facts
136	( Joyce 2006 ) .
137	Given that our moral beliefs are influenced by evolutionary forces ,
138	and not by the moral facts ,
139	our moral beliefs would be the same
140	even if the moral facts would change .
141	But
142	because we should not hold on to such insensitive beliefs ,
143	evolutionary explanations of morality show
144	that our moral beliefs are unjustified
145	( because they are not sensitive ) .
146	It is not clear , however , whether and why evolutionary explanations of morality reveal something about our moral beliefs
147	that is particularly troubling from an epistemological perspective .
148	The impact of evolutionary ethics on epistemological questions depends on these deeper questions about epistemology .
149	[ 13 ]
150	Evolutionary explanations of morality , however , provide us with a useful starting point
151	for thinking about these questions .
152	See Klenk ( 2019 ) .
Evoethics{>1}Conclusion
153	CONCLUSION
154	Evolutionary ethics has helped us to get a much clearer sense
155	of where the human moral sense is coming from .
156	While this is a far cry from revealing to us what we ought to do ,
157	the research program seems full of promise nonetheless .
158	Once we get into the details ,
159	we can see that it also raises deep theoretical questions about evolutionary explanations , the relation of descriptive and normative claims , the epistemology of justification and truth , and the general viability of naturalism in ethics .
160	Much left to wonder , then ,
161	but with some ideas
162	about where to get our answers .
