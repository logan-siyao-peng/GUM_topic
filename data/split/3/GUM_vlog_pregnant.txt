1	Hi everyone !
2	So I 'm just about to tuck into a crisp sandwich .
3	Salt vinegar squares are my crisp of choice .
4	And I 've got some apple juice
5	because this signifies kind of my diet staples the last few weeks .
Diet{<2}AnnouncesPregnancy
6	So I thought
7	this was an opportune time
8	to tell you all
9	that a couple of weeks ago I found out
10	that I am pregnant .
IntroPregnant{>1}ReactionsAnxietyAndExperience
11	It 's the first week
12	that I 've been actually able to say the words " I 'm pregnant "
13	and have it not feel really weird .
14	I found out on ,
15	I think
16	it was the 3rd of January .
17	Let 's just double check that .
18	No , excuse me ,
19	it was the fifth of January .
20	I found out on the fifth
21	and that was
22	because my period was late
23	and I am never late .
24	As soon as I came off the pill
25	my period came back pretty regularly
26	and I started tracking my periods
27	just because I knew
28	the pregnancy was something
29	that eventually we would want ,
30	and I know
31	that it helps if you 've been tracking your period
32	so you know your cycle .
33	And for the first few days / couple of weeks I felt really anxious , really scared , really worried ,
34	because my initial reaction was ,
35	and still now , I 'm a bit like ,
36	I 'm not old enough for this .
37	I 'm not grown up enough
38	to do this .
39	You feel like you 're prepared ,
40	you 're in a ,
41	you know ,
42	in a relationship .
43	We have been for years ,
44	we 're adults ,
45	but I do n't know what it is .
46	As soon as I found out
47	I just went back to like a 14 year old girl .
48	I 'm like
49	" oh my god , what am I gon na tell my mom ?
50	I ca n't be a mom . "
51	So really I was just very very overwhelmed and anxious
52	so it took a few days for me to really process what happened .
53	It was quite a shock
54	and it 's such a huge huge thing .
55	It 's life - changing ,
56	and so for the first couple of weeks that 's all
57	I could focus on ,
58	was how life - changing it was
59	and it was really scary .
60	I then started to talk to people about it ,
61	that made me feel better .
InitialReactions{=3}Vlogging
62	And , I 'm not really sure what I 'm trying to say .
63	I do n't want this to be too , like , all over the place
64	but I decided
65	I do want to document this some way ,
66	whether I –
67	At first I was like ,
68	I do n't need to copy it on YouTube
69	but I definitely wanted to document this in some kind of video form ,
70	just because it 's such a huge thing .
71	You ’re only pregnant for the first time once .
72	But I did want to document my first trimester to an extent ,
73	because
74	when I first found out ,
75	I did start to watch videos of people 's first few weeks ,
76	but again ,
77	maybe because I was n't in a great headspace ,
78	that just frightened me ,
79	which again was because everyone was just saying how awful they felt , how excited they were ,
80	and I did n't feel excited .
81	I felt worried .
82	The thought
83	of telling , like , my mom .
84	I cried
85	when I told her
86	because I felt so , just , like , oh my god .
87	I mean
88	you , you feel quite bad
89	when you feel like that ,
90	because it 's such a happy thing
91	and now ,
92	you know ,
93	I –
94	you know ,
95	I know
96	I 've kind of accepted .
97	The shock has kind of sunk in .
98	And I am happy to tell people ,
99	but at first
100	when you 're trying to get your head around it ,
101	it 's very daunting
102	and you just feel awful
103	thinking .
104	The thought
105	of telling someone
106	makes me want to burst into tears .
107	All these things going onto my head .
108	So that also then helped me to make the decision
109	that I do want to document this ,
110	but I 'm probably going to do it , like , with hindsight ,
111	so I check in every now and again
112	and just let you know how I 've been feeling .
113	But in terms
114	of if I am sick
115	or I 'm not feeling great ,
116	I 'm not gon na vlog
117	whilst I feel like that .
118	I would n't want to vlog
119	whilst I feel like that
120	if I was just ill anyway .
121	And I just think
122	it did n't help me seeing people at their worst at the very beginning ,
123	because all you hear is doom and gloom .
124	I decided to wait a few weeks
125	before I even started to talk about it ,
126	so I think
127	I 'm about seven weeks .
InitialReactionsAndVlogging{=2}FirstFewWeeksExperience
128	I am waiting for my first midwife appointment .
129	I went –
130	I booked the doctors ,
131	because the NHS says
132	you need to book a doctor 's appointment ,
133	but that was a waste of time
134	and I felt quite bad
135	about taking that appointment .
136	Because in my area you 'd have to self - refer ,
137	so I have n't had any kind of appointment or checkups or anything
138	but I have been tracking
139	– tracking –
140	I 've got an app
141	called " what to expect " ,
142	put in my ,
143	you know ,
144	cycle situation
145	and have an estimated due date ,
146	which is about mid-September .
Appointments{=3}Symptoms
147	In terms of symptoms ,
148	I mean
149	I have n't felt the best ,
150	but I have been able to get through it .
151	I 've definitely struggled on some days
152	but I have n't been sick .
153	The biggest thing for me is I have lost –
154	I dipped ,
155	and I have lost my appetite .
156	There 's nothing
157	I really feel like eating .
158	I do n't have particular aversions to things ,
159	I do n't feel really sick
160	when I smell anything at the moment .
161	But there 's things
162	that I do n't want to have ,
163	so like coffee ,
164	I just know
165	that I do n't want that ,
166	and all I want is beige :
167	I want chips ,
168	I want white toast ,
169	it 's pretty much all
170	I eat all day .
171	Pasta
172	if I want something hot maybe ,
173	I 've had soup ,
174	but essentially starchy carbs
175	and that 's quite normal
176	it seems .
177	Like , everyone craves that at this point
178	because you 're ,
179	you know ,
180	building a baby ,
181	so you need that energy .
182	So I do n't feel particularly great nutrition-wise ,
183	and I 'm trying to eat fruit
184	where I can
185	and veg
186	when I can ,
187	but I 'm just sort of going with it ,
188	because I know
189	there 's enough information out there
190	that this is generally how it goes .
191	And then hopefully you start to feel a bit better .
192	I have felt nauseous and
193	as everyone describes it ,
194	a bit jet - lagged , a bit cloudy in my head ,
195	and the worst thing for me has been headaches .
196	I have n't had them this week ,
197	but last week I had a couple of really really bad ones
198	and I have n't had headaches that bad for years .
