14	Method 1 of 3 :
15	Starting Seeds
MethodOneSeedsTitle{<3}Steps
16	1 Choose the kind of basil
17	you wish to grow .
18	Basil comes in many different varieties ,
19	each of which have a unique flavor and smell .
20	Read up on different types of basil
21	and pick out one
22	- or several -
23	that appeal to you ,
24	then order the seeds
25	or buy them at a garden store .
26	Here are a few ideas :
27	Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice ,
28	and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers .
29	Lemon basil actually contains citral , an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit ,
30	and smells very lemony .
31	Purple basil is often grown for decoration , as well as its scent and flowers .
32	There are perennial basils
33	which come back year after year ,
34	like African Blue Basil
35	( which has pretty blue veins on its leaves )
36	and Thai Basil ,
37	while most other varieties are annuals ,
38	which you 'll have to plant year after year .
39	Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow ,
40	but form pretty little bushes
41	which stay well - contained .
42	2 Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost .
43	Basil needs warm air and sun
44	to do well ,
45	so it 's often easiest to start the seeds indoors
46	instead of risking that they 'll get damaged by frost .
47	If you live in a hot climate ,
48	you can start the seeds outside instead .
49	To figure out when the last frost will be ,
50	consult an almanac
51	or talk with other gardeners in your area .
52	3 Prepare seed containers .
53	Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite , vermiculite , and peat .
54	Press the mixture slightly
55	to eliminate air pockets .
56	Dampen the mixture with water
57	so it 's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate .
58	4 Plant the seeds .
59	Drop one to two seeds into each container .
60	Cover them lightly with soil .
61	Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap ,
62	so they stay moist .
63	Leave the containers in a sunny window .
64	Twice daily , remove the plastic wrap
65	and sprinkle the containers with more water .
66	5 Remove the plastic wrap
67	when the sprouts emerge .
68	When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil ,
69	it 's time
70	to remove the plastic wrap .
71	Keep watering the sprouts twice daily ,
72	never letting the soil dry out .
73	When the plants become a few inches tall
74	and their leaves mature ,
75	it 's time
76	to transplant them to a larger container .
MethodOne{=2}MethodsTwoAndThree
77	Method 2 of 3 :
78	Caring for Basil
79	1 Transplant the basil plants .
80	Once two sets of leaves have formed ,
81	basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers .
82	Basil does not tolerate frost
83	so do n't plant too early .
84	It 's best to put basil somewhere
85	where it will get a good deal of sunshine
86	and have well - drained soil .
87	To plant the basil in the garden ,
88	dig holes
89	spaced at least 6 inches apart .
90	Place the roots in the holes
91	and place soil around the stems .
92	Pat down soil around the plants
93	to eliminate air pockets .
94	If you want to plant the basil in a container ,
95	make sure it 's large enough
96	to accommodate the number of plants
97	you 're growing ;
98	they need to be planted 6 inches apart ,
99	since they grow quite large .
100	2 Keep the soil damp ,
101	but not soaked .
102	Basil does best in well - drained soil ,
103	and should not be subjected to standing water .
104	Water the mature basil plants once a day , in the morning ,
105	so the water has time
106	to soak in
107	and evaporate
108	rather than sitting on the plants overnight .
109	3 Pinch off flower heads .
110	When you see flower buds ,
111	pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off .
112	Flowers blooming create a hormone change
113	which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves ,
114	as well as reducing the amount of foliage
115	which grows .
116	This is called " bolting "
117	and is more likely to happen
118	when there 's extra sunshine .
119	You 'll notice
120	that
121	if you leave the flowers ,
122	the plant will become lanky
123	and the leaves wo n't be as full or tasty .
124	4 Watch for pests and mold .
125	Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles
126	the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand .
127	If your plants show signs of mold growth ,
128	they may not be getting adequate sunlight ,
129	or they may be too close together .
130	Weed out the smaller plants
131	to give the larger ones more space .
MethodTwo{=3}MethodThree
132	Method 3 of 3 :
133	Harvesting and Using Basil
134	1 Harvest
135	and prune .
136	As the plant matures ,
137	pinch off the top two pairs of leaves
138	once a stalk reaches a reasonable height .
139	If you look closely ,
140	at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves
141	that will grow outwards
142	if the stem growing between them is cut off .
143	Cut close to those tiny leaves ,
144	but be sure not to damage them .
145	Pinching encourages the plant 's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves .
146	This helps the plants grow bushy .
147	Do n't pinch on the lower part of the stem ,
148	or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy .
149	You want them to get bushy ,
150	so pinch from the top .
151	2 Enjoy the basil fresh .
152	Rinse off the leaves
153	and use the basil
154	to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese .
155	3 Store the basil in the refrigerator .
156	You 'll probably have more basil
157	than you could possibly eat fresh ,
158	so plan on storing some in the fridge .
159	Wash the leaves ,
160	dry them well ,
161	and wrap them in paper towels .
162	Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid .
163	4 Freeze the basil .
164	Freezing the leaves whole does n't work very well ,
165	but
166	if you puree it first
167	you can freeze it for months .
168	Place the basil in a blender with a little water .
169	Puree it
170	until smooth ,
171	then put it in a food storage bag
172	and freeze
173	until you need it .
