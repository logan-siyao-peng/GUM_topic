3	October is National Magic Month in the United States .
4	Wikinews spoke with William Evans , president of the International Brotherhood of Magicians , about the current state of magic and what its future looks like in the world of entertainment .
5	For how long have you been involved
6	in performing / studying magic ?
Question{<3}Response
7	Over 50 years .
8	I am 61 now
9	so I really started
10	when I was about 10 years old
11	even though I had seen and worked with some basic tricks a few years earlier .
12	I remember
13	going into Hollywood Magic
14	and wanting that big red box with the dragons on it
15	and I did n't even know
16	what it did .
17	The magician behind the counter was wise enough
18	not to sell it to me ,
19	but instead sold me two books
20	which I still own today -
21	" Scarne on Card Tricks " and " Scarne on Magic Tricks " .
22	That started me out on books
23	and I have amassed quite a few since then .
24	My major influences on performance are Eugene Burger and Michael Skinner .

25	October is National Magic Month in the US .
26	Do you think
27	magic is alive as a viable form of entertainment today ?
28	Absolutely .
29	There are more magicians
30	working today
31	than ever before .
32	There will always be an audience for good magicians
33	doing good magic .
34	Has the internet helped or hurt magic ?
35	Both .
36	I think
37	it has helped draw younger people to magic as a hobby ,
38	but I think
39	it has hurt the ability of young magicians
40	to think
41	because so many rely on the internet for everything
42	and they are n't reading the books .
43	We have to have knowledge of the history of magic and what has been done before .
44	Moreover , seeing someone perform on the internet takes away the use of our senses , originality and imagination
45	that reading and thinking about magic can produce .
46	Anyone can become a monkey ;
47	it takes serious study
48	to become a magician .
