1	What is up guys ?
2	Kharma Medic here
3	and welcome back to another dose .
4	So in today 's video , I 'm finally gon na be doing a room tour .
5	I know
6	this is something
7	that you guys have requested for a very long time ,
8	and after two and a half years
9	of living here ,
LongRequested{=2}ReadyToGiveTour
10	I finally feel
11	like I 've made it my own
12	and decorated it
13	how I want ,
14	and I 'm ready to show it to you guys .
VideoIntro{<1}TourBegins
15	Alright so let 's start off with the bed and the couch area .
IntroStartBedCouchArea{<2}Tour
16	Honestly ,
17	if I was redoing this from the beginning ,
18	I would have really liked to have a double bed in this room ,
19	but , unfortunately , with the space
20	as you can probably see from that wall there till the door ,
21	it 's basically just enough
22	to fit a bed and a couch ,
23	and this is my couch over here .
24	I 've recently changed it ,
25	and
26	if you 've been following my channel for a long time ,
27	then you 'll know
28	I 'm really proud of how I color match the pictures on the wall over here with sort of the gray and yellow vibe , the gray and yellow cushions .
29	This couch is also quite big ,
30	it fits three people quite comfortably ,
31	and
32	if I have family or friends staying over ,
33	it opens up into a full double bed .
34	This coffee table over here , it 's glass
35	and has two levels ,
36	so it 's really good
37	when we have multiple friends over ,
38	and we have lots of food
39	to put on the table ,
40	or
41	if we 're playing board games ,
42	we can have people sit around it ,
43	and still have a lot of space
44	to lay everything out .
CouchArea{=3}BedArea
45	So there 's nothing too special about the bed itself ,
46	but it does have a very important function ,
47	which , it has a lot of storage .
48	So down here is basically where I keep everything
49	that I ca n't really keep in my room ,
50	because there 's not enough space .
51	I 've got an ironing board , all of my suitcases , socks , clothes
52	that I do n't wear that often ,
53	anything
54	that I need
55	for fixing the house
56	like screwdrivers , drills , nails , all these things
57	that I definitely would n't want to have laid out in my room ,
58	but I still need somewhere in the house .
59	I love that this room has floor - to - ceiling windows as well ,
60	it really lets the light come in , especially in the summer time .
61	I know
62	London does n't have that much light ,
63	but I 'll take as much
64	as I can ,
65	and there 's also a small balcony out here ,
66	which is fairly rare for London .
67	We have two chairs
68	where we can sit down
69	and sort of enjoy the weather
70	when it is a little bit better ,
71	um but now it 's really cold
72	so just gon na close it .
73	And then a little behind the scenes
74	that you probably will never see again in a video
75	is that down here I keep all of the filming gear
76	that does n't really fit anywhere else in the room :
77	two sets of tripods ,
78	I also have a c - stand .
79	Okay next to my bed , I 've got the radio alarm clock ,
80	and this has actually changed my life .
81	It makes waking up in the morning and getting out of bed at 6:00 a.m.
82	when it 's pitch black outside
83	so much easier
84	when you 're waking up really early .
85	It 's so much better to wake up to the sound
86	of somebody talking to you :
87	your favorite radio station , some music , whatever ,
88	instead of that classic iPhone alarm , " ba , ba , ba . "
89	Over here on the wall , these are posters
90	that I actually bought back in 2013 in my first year of university in Toronto ,
91	and I really really liked them
92	so I 've kept them around .
93	Also I 'm really proud
94	that I managed to put them up all by myself ,
95	they look quite neat ,
96	and I feel
97	like they 're equally spaced ,
98	so I 'm really proud of how they turned out .
