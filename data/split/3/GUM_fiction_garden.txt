1	The day
2	it rained in the garden
3	The first drops of rain fell onto the parched stones from a cloudless blue sky .
4	They disappeared immediately ,
5	drunk down into the mineral silence .
FirstSignsItWillRain{<2}EveryoneWaiting
6	The garden paused ,
7	and everything held its breath
8	and waited .
9	More rain would come .
10	Everyone knew , beyond belief or necessity
11	that the time had come .
12	And with it , the rain .
EveryoneWaiting{=3}DescriptionsAndWaiting
13	Heavy oily drops bounced from leaf to grass to dusty ground ,
14	gathering in stems and folds on the way .
15	Yet still the sky was a hard polished blue with not a cloud in sight .
16	Still the garden held its breath .
17	It would not be long now .
18	A spattering of drops plucked memories from deep in the roots ,
19	shivering through shoots and tendrils , humus and stone .
20	Wispy vapour trails marbled the blue surface above .
AnticipatingRain{=1}RainAndWater
21	And then it rained for good .
22	We sat on the porch
23	watching ,
24	no longer daring to dart out and leap around in the downfall
25	as drops turned to torrents
26	and the staccato tapping on the roof climaxed to a thunderous roar .
27	Pools erupted
28	and overflowed along the edges of the lawn ,
29	cascading around the raspberry canes and over the flower beds .
30	Earthworms rose up from the water - laden earth
31	where they could no longer breath
32	and wriggled
33	and struggled fro air on the surface ,
34	writhing and swimming for a safe haven .
35	Water burst over the barrels and cans
36	standing under the eaves and gutters ,
37	flooding the pathways ,
38	carrying away all
39	that was n’t fixed solid
40	and licking at the stairs to the back porch
41	before climbing each step
42	and lapping against the planks
43	we were sitting on ,
44	a wooden raft
45	surrounded by angry water and martial beat
46	drum , drum , drumming on the roof above .
EruptionOfWater{=3}WaterAndFish
47	We slipped out feet over the sides
48	and
49	when we felt the fish ,
50	some as big as logs ,
51	some as small as leaves ,
52	nibble at our feet ,
53	we leant over
54	to watch them fraying and frolicking under the choppy surface .
55	Waves lapped at the porch ,
56	washing away the boxes , and bowls , and the dog ’s basket .
57	The rocking chair , the watering can , boxes of cuttings , and tied - up newspapers , all floated away
58	as we slammed the kitchen door shut
59	and retreated to the front room
60	we gazed out at the river
61	that the street had become .
62	The sky was pewter
63	smeared with charcoal now ,
64	and pressed down hard on the rooftops ,
65	slowly dissolving everything below .
66	When the water rippled into the hallway ,
67	we splashed our way to the staircase and then up
68	as it nipped at our heels .
TransformationOfGarden{=2}AnticipateCaptain'sArrival
69	Outside the other houses were rocks
70	surrounded by sea
71	with mermaids swimming all around ,
72	flapping their scaly tails
73	and hauling themselves up ,
74	to fall backwards into the crest of the oncoming waves .
75	And as they swam
76	they sang ,
77	their voices born on the winds and the salt and the rain ,
78	and we could hear them singing ,
79	He is coming ,
80	He is coming .
81	And they combed their long hair in preparation .
82	We waved
83	and called ,
84	and they laughed
85	and played ,
86	tantalising ,
87	their seaweed locks just out of reach .
88	With a flick of the tail they were off ,
89	still singing ,
90	He is coming ,
91	He is coming ,
92	until their voices were lost in the noise of the rain and the water .
93	A great whiskered head arose ,
94	then a belly ,
95	wet
96	and sleek ,
97	long enough to wrap itself twice around the world .
98	“ Is it him ? ”
99	we asked each other ,
100	nudging elbows
101	and climbing onto the chairs .
102	We pulled off wet socks and shoes ,
103	letting them float away on the tide ,
104	before the great worm turned
105	and the wake engulfed the creaking , cracking house .
106	We clambered up onto the roof ,
107	sliding on the tiles
108	and clinging to chimney stacks ,
109	sheltering our eyes from the driving downpour .
110	The sky was black ,
111	and the stormy sea all the deepest , darkest blues and greens and greys
112	and flecked with white
113	where the sea - horses galloped .
114	The waters broke
115	making way for the gnarled head of a whale ,
116	spouting water high against the clouds
117	before opening its whiskered maw
118	and in a looming , booming voice called :
119	He is coming ,
120	He is coming .
121	The chimneys washed away ,
122	so we scrambled onto the blue - black back
123	encrusted with barnacles and cockles like stars in a night sky
124	and held on tight
125	as he rode the waves ,
126	dipping
127	and blowing ,
128	dipping
129	and blowing .
130	The wind and the rain tugged at our hair .
131	And still it rained .
132	We heard a fearsome creaking and cracking
133	and before our eyes a great patch of sky peeled away ,
134	deeping down in the troughs
135	and riding the crests
136	with torn sails set against the wind .
137	It was a galleon with masts like a dead man ’s fingers ,
138	tarred timbers groaning
139	and a mermaid sat on the bow
140	as he ship dipped
141	and passed .
142	He is coming ,
143	He is coming ,
144	she sang out .
145	And just as the wash hit us ,
146	prising us from the whale ’s speckled back and down into the sea ,
147	someone threw down a knotted rope
148	and we hung on for dear life .
149	The singing sailors hauled us aboard
150	chanting ,
151	He ’s a coming - ha !
152	He ’s a coming - ha !
153	And we fell onto the deck
154	like fish bursting from a net .
AnticipateMysteriousArrival{=3}ArrivalOfCaptain
155	The Captain stood above us
156	dressed in jewels and finery from a thousand pillagings .
