1	Cool .
2	Alright folks .
3	Well alreet , well alroot , well alright .
Fillers{<3}ItemsOnTable
4	By now I 'm sure
5	you 're wondering about the different things
6	that I have on the table here ,
AcknowledgeItemsOnTable{<2}ThreeStatesOfMatter
7	but first , I would like to talk to you about these three items .
TurnToThreeItems{<3}ThreeStatesOfMatter
8	I have here , some ice in a pan ,
9	water in this glass ,
10	and steam rising from this pot .
11	Now , I would like to ask you , how these three things .
12	Tell me please .
13	How are they all alike .
14	These three things .
15	This ice here in this pan .
16	This water in this glass , and the steam
17	rising from this pot ,
18	just yell it out ,
19	we are informal here , yes .
20	Correct .
21	They are all forms of water .
22	This ice here of course is water ,
23	I told you
24	there was water in this glass ,
25	and you have all seen water boil at home ,
26	so you are familiar with steam .
27	But now let 's try to figure out how they 're different ,
28	we 'll look at temperature , first .
29	And the temperature of this water here , the ice , is , about uh twenty - four – woo- nineteen degrees .
30	Very cold .
31	The temperature of this w- water here , is sixty - four degrees ,
32	the temperature of this steam , is ,
33	I know
34	it 's hotter than that .
35	Yeah , it 's about a hundred and eleven degrees .
36	Okay .
37	Fahrenheit .
38	Okay .
39	Oh , and by the way guys , what do we call something that 's hard , like this ice here , or a table , or a rock ?
40	We call it a ?
41	Solid .
42	Very good .
43	You should g- — you should be a choir .
44	You should go out on the road there , like , yeah .
45	We are .
46	Y- — oh well ,
47	I 'm glad to meet you .
48	Please give me your itinerary after the show .
49	Yes .
50	Yes .
51	Of course we call it a sholids .
52	A solid .
53	And a solid has one shape .
54	The shape
55	that it starts out with .
56	And what do we call something
57	that you — that you can splish splash ?
58	Take a bath in .
59	Anything wet like soda or milk .
60	Liquid .
61	You 're not gon na let me finish ,
62	are you ?
63	Yes , we call it a ?
64	Liquid .
65	Very good .
66	And a liquid can change its shape ,
67	to f- completely fill the bottom of whatever container
68	you put it in .
69	And finally , what do we call something
70	that 's loose ,
71	and floating around like this steam here ?
72	Or a cloud , or the air
73	we breathe ,
74	we call it a ?
75	Gas .
76	Correct .
77	A gas .
78	And a gas completely fills whatever shape container
79	you put it in .
80	And so , how do you get water to change , from a solid , to a liquid , to a gas , and back and forth ?
81	Add energy .
82	Woo .
83	I like the way
84	he expressed that .
85	Never before have I heard it ,
86	add or subtract energy , or , heat ,
87	change the temperature , basically .
88	Correct ?
ThreeStatesOfMatter{=1}Balloons
89	Alright .
90	Well folks , now I 'm going to show you something else
91	that happens
92	when you change the temperature ,
ChangeTemperature{=3}Balloons
93	and that 's where these balloons come in .
94	I have here a number of balloons ,
95	but , l- let 's see
96	how many of these balloons , I can fit , into this little itty - bitty container here .
97	Well , everybody count together .
98	This would be ...
99	There 's a- in there .
100	You think , well , okay , w- th- th- ,
101	I 'm glad
102	I never saw d- Citizen Kane with you .
103	Rosebud is a sled .
104	Okay .
ChangeTemperatureAddBalloons{=2}Count
105	Well , let 's all count together folks ,
106	that was ?
107	One .
108	One .
109	Very good .
110	One balloon going into the little container here .
111	And this would be ...
112	Two .
113	Two .
114	Very good counting there .
115	Two .
116	Excellent .
117	Two balloons going into the little container here .
118	Ah , they 're not fitting in so easily .
119	Oh no .
120	So hopefully I can fit all balloons into this little container here .
121	Oh stop guessing at what this is .
122	Let 's have some suspense here .
123	Come on .
124	Alright .
125	And this would be ?
126	Three .
127	Three .
128	Very good .
129	Three balloons going onto the the little container there .
130	Three balloons .
131	Three , yes , the balloon trinity .
132	And now , this would be ?
133	Eight .
134	Four .
135	Four .
136	Very good .
137	At first he was confused ,
138	but then he figured it out .
139	Everybody tell him what this is ,
140	it 's ...
141	Seven .
142	It 's four .
143	Boy you people did n't watch enough Sesame Street as a child .
144	This would be ?
145	Five .
146	Thank you very much , yes .
147	Five swollen balloons .
148	In .
149	In .
150	Down .
151	Down .
152	Ah , ah .
153	Okay .
154	And this would be ?
155	Six .
156	Six ,
157	good .
158	And let 's do this uh ,
159	let 's add some complexities to this here ,
160	let 's do it in another language .
161	In Spanish it would be ?
162	Ocho .
163	Seis .
164	S- seis .
165	N- ocho .
166	Oh my gosh .
167	I 'm afraid for our nation .
168	Okay , well , and this would be ?
169	Siete .
170	Thank you .
171	Seven .
172	Right ?
173	Seven .
174	Okay .
175	And finally , this would be ?
176	Eight .
177	Ocho .
178	Eight , or ocho in Spanish ,
179	and uh huit in French ,
180	thank you very much .
181	I thought
182	you were telling me your breakfast .
183	What you had for b- —
184	But no , huit .
185	Very good .
EightBalloons{<3}HowTheBalloonsFit
186	Oh my gosh , eight balloons into this little container here ,
187	I bet
188	you 're wondering r-
189	how that happened .
190	You popped two .
191	There 's a hole in it .
192	Well , there 's a hole ,
193	no ,
194	if you 're thinking
195	there 's a hole ,
196	think again .
197	Because , there 's no hole in the counter at all .
198	Pull em out .
199	You slowed down the molecules ,
200	Well – la duh dah dih duh duh , you 're getting a little ahead of me son .
201	Let 's all figure it out together .
