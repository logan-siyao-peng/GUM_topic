2	We hypothesized
3	that the children ,
4	who were over the age of six at the time of collection ,
5	would have adult - like SI interpretations .
MainHypothesis{>5}Additions
6	We expected
7	that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity
8	over providing truth value judgments ,
9	and would result in adult - like interpretations .
10	Further , we posited
11	that
12	if our initial hypothesis was not supported ,
13	and in fact there was some non - adult - like performance ,
14	that there would be significant variability among the conditions ,
15	with cardinal numbers having the highest performance
16	and some the weakest .
Hypothesis{=4}Findings
17	On the surface , it does seem as if there is variability
18	and perhaps a larger sample size or more items could lead to a significant finding
19	( see limitations below ) ,
20	but at least for this study , the only significant finding was the difference between cardinal numbers and some .
21	Significant differences were not observed between all and cardinal numbers or all and some .

22	4.1. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS .
LimitationsAndFutureDirectionsTitle{<3}Content
23	This study is limited in its power and generalizability .
IntroLimitation{=5}Value
24	It serves as a reminder of the work
25	that needs to be completed for the cross-linguistic study of SI in particular and acquisition more generally .
26	Bantu languages are not included in studies of acquisition often enough
27	despite the numerous languages in this linguistic grouping and the millions of people
28	using them .
IntroLimitationAndValue{<4}FutureStudiesAndLimitations
29	Future studies need to include more participants and more items
30	to increase power .
31	Future studies should also include a larger age range of children
32	to document the age
33	at which adult - like performance emerges .
34	Related cross-cultural studies have resulted in insufficient statistical power ,
35	but interesting trends
36	( e.g. , Nedwick , 2014 ) .
37	Follow - up studies with increased stimuli and participants are needed .
38	In a future study , it is also important to consider
39	if additional training in the difference
40	between reporting on felicity and truth value judgments
41	would impact results ,
42	or if more naturalistic experimental conditions
43	( e.g. , demonstrating actions
44	using real objects instead of two - dimensional depictions )
45	would be beneficial .
46	Previous studies in this region of sub-Saharan Africa have found evidence of cultural differences in testing behavior
47	( Hein , Reich , Marks , Thuma , & Grigorenko , 2016 ) .
FutureStudies{=5}CurrentStudyLimitations
48	The current study is too small
49	to make strong conclusions with regard to cultural differences and experimental methods ;
50	however , in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found
51	that children responded more or less frequently
52	based on factors such as stimuli type .
53	In the current study , the responses from two children were not included
54	because they responded the same way to every item through the training and all test items .
55	More specifically , they answered “ yes ”
56	that the puppet described the pictures well .
57	It is possible that these two children understood the task
58	and really did believe
59	that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions ,
60	and in this regard , are not yet adult - like in their SI interpretations .
61	This is unlikely
62	as they said
63	that even the first training item was said well .
64	It is also possible though that these two children were attempting to please the data collectors , or be polite ,
65	and that “ yes ” was in some ways a default answer
66	to be provided
67	when having to respond verbally in a test context .
68	Additional training with the methodology could improve outcomes .
69	The puppets
70	used
71	were picked specifically for this task with careful attention to their appearance .
72	Upon arrival at the school , however , it became clear that the children were not accustomed to playing with puppets
73	and that the data collection would be a novel experience for them .
74	Further exploration with greater cardinal number ranges could also prove interesting .
75	Numbers through five in the participating communities are most often expressed with native Chitonga words
76	while numbers greater than five are typically indicated
77	using English borrowings .
78	The cardinal numbers
79	included in this study
80	were only one through five
81	in order to avoid additional item variability ,
82	but larger numbers should be included in future research .

ConclusionTitle{<2}Content
84	Albeit limited ,
LimitedFindings{<4}MainFindings
85	these results provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga - speaking children
86	and demonstrate
87	that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order
88	identified in previous research ,
89	but appears to be completed at a later age in this language .
MainFindings{>3}SituateFindingsInExistingKnowledge
90	This interesting combination of findings
91	– expected hierarchy of difficulty , but differing age of acquisition –
92	is an important addition to our growing cross-linguistic knowledge of SI
93	and could be the result of language - specific differences in the use of SI lexical items or methodological differences .
