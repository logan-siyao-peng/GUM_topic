1	Introduction
2	A fundamental tenet of linguistic science is that the sound of a word has a purely arbitrary connection to the word 's meaning
3	[ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
FirstTenent{>4}Example
4	Thus , the sound of the word dog in English is connected to the concept ‘ dog ’ by historical accident and not by any natural connection ;
5	roughly the same concept is just as well denoted in French by chien ,
6	in German by hund ,
7	and in Japanese by inu .
SoundArbitrary{=3}RestrictedPossibleSoundsPerLanguage
8	But it is not that a word can have just any vocal sound .
9	While the possibility space for sound systems of the world 's language is enormous ,
10	any given language makes use of only a restricted portion of the possible sounds
11	[ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
TwoTenets{=2}Conclusion
12	It follows from these two basic principles
13	– the ‘ arbitrariness of the sign ’ , and the ‘ selectiveness of particular sound systems ’ –
RestatePrinciples{<3}Conclusions
14	that the words
15	that exist in the world 's languages
16	should sound quite different from each other ,
LanguagesSoundDifferent{=4}LowLikelihoodUniversalWords
17	and that the likelihood
18	that there are universal words
19	is extremely small .
TwoBasicLinguisticPrinciples{<1}ThisStudy
20	But in this study we present a striking exception to this otherwise robust rule .
Exception{<4}HuhIsUniversal
21	From a systematic comparison of 10 spoken languages from 5 continents we find evidence
22	suggesting
Languages{<5}HuhIsUniversal
23	that a word like ‘ Huh ? ’
24	– used as a ‘ repair initiator ’
25	when , for example , one has not clearly heard
26	what someone just said
27	[ 5 ] , [ 6 ] –
28	is a universal word .
IntroHuh{=3}ClaimsAndExplanation
29	There are two distinct claims
30	being made here :
31	1. that Huh ? is universal ,
32	and 2. that Huh ? is a word .
IntroClaims{>5}Elaboration
33	In support of the first claim ,
34	we show
35	that the similarities in form and function of an interjection with the specific function of repair initiation are very much greater across languages
36	than chance coincidence would admit .
37	In fact the variation in form in unrelated languages across the globe is about the same as the variation
38	we find in the way
39	any regular word
40	( e.g. , dog )
41	is pronounced across dialects of English .
42	In support of the second claim ,
43	we show
44	that Huh ? meets the criteria of a word in the sense
45	of being a conventional lexical sign
46	which must be learnt .
47	Thus , in contrast to what has been presumed for interjections in general
48	[ 7 ] , [ 8 ]
49	and for huh ? in particular
50	[ 9 ] , [ 10 ] ,
51	we find
52	that this item is linguistic in nature
53	rather than being a mere grunt or non-lexical sound .
54	We show
55	that the form is locally calibrated in ways
56	that show
57	it fitting within different language systems .
58	Huh ? may be a non-prototypical word ,
59	but it is a word .
Claims{=4}AddressWhyThisPhenomenonOccurs
60	Finally , we address the question
61	of why all languages should have such a word
62	and why its form should be so similar across languages .
WhyThisPhenomenonOccurs{<5}Explanation
63	We observe
64	that this item fulfils a crucial need
65	shared by all languages
66	– the efficient signalling of problems
67	of hearing
68	and understanding –
69	and we propose
70	that its form is constrained by selective pressures in a conversational environment
71	that is essentially the same in all languages .
IntroHuhAndClaims{=2}ExamplesAndMethodology
72	Consider a case from English
73	[ 10 ] :
74	Extract 1 American English
75	[ NB , 1:1:19 ]
IntroExtract1{<5}Content
76	After speaker G makes a statement ,
77	speaker E utters the interjection huh ? .
78	This is followed by a repetition of the original statement by G .
79	The technical term for this type of sequence is “ open other - initiated repair ” :
80	repair is initiated not by the speaker of the first turn
81	but by the other participant
82	( “ other - initiated ” ) ,
83	and the repair initiator signals
84	that there is a problem ,
85	but it leaves open what the problem is
86	( “ open ” )
87	[ 11 ] .
88	The actual repair operation in response to this interjection is usually simply repetition , sometimes with slight modification .
Extract1{=4}Extracts2And3
89	Extracts 2 and 3 show structurally identical sequences in two other languages :
90	Siwu , a Kwa language
91	spoken in Ghana ,
92	and Lao , a Tai - Kadai language
93	spoken in Laos .

99	[ CONV_050815c_03.10 ]
100	These examples show
101	that it is possible to identify the same conversational structure in unrelated languages .
SampleExtracts{=3}Methodology
102	Essentially , this method gives us a natural control over conversational data ,
103	making possible systematic comparison across languages
104	[ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
NaturalControl{>5}SimilarAcross
105	Sequences of other - initiated repair have been identified in every spoken language investigated so far
106	[ 14 ] , [ 15 ] ,
107	and
108	as the examples show ,
109	the interjection in the pivotal turn can be remarkably similar .
MethodAdvantage{<4}Methodology
110	This leads to the question
111	driving our study :
112	is huh ? in this context a universal word ?
113	By compiling data from published literature
114	we found
115	that in thirty - one languages around the world , the interjection for other - initiated repair appears to be strongly similar
116	( Figure 1 ) .
117	However , written sources are rarely explicit about the precise form , meaning , and use of interjections .
QuestionAndPreviousLiterature{=5}Methodology
118	The most reliable way
119	to study a conversational interjection
120	is by examining cases of actual use .
121	Therefore we collected data from recordings of naturally occurring informal conversations in a sample of 10 languages from 5 continents ,
122	varying fundamentally in terms of phonology , word structure , and grammar
123	( languages 1 – 10 in Figure 1 ) .
124	For optimal comparability , we studied the exact same conversational environment across languages :
125	that of other - initiated repair
126	( OIR ) ,
127	in which one participant produces a turn at talk ,
128	the other then signals some trouble with this turn ,
129	and finally the first produces a next turn
130	which aims to solve the trouble , usually by means of repetition and / or modification .
131	In some languages the interjection , or an item similar to it , was also found in other sequential environments ,
132	for instance to mark surprise
133	or to pursue a response .
134	Such alternative
135	( and probably derived )
136	uses provide insight in possible paths of semantic change ,
137	but we exclude them here
138	to make sure
139	we are comparing like with like .
