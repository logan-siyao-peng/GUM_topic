1	I wish to make a ministerial statement about the first confirmed case of COVID - 19 in New Zealand .
2	On Friday , 28 February , New Zealand recorded its first case of the COVID - 19 coronavirus ,
3	becoming the 48th country
4	to have a confirmed case .
IntroFirstConfimedCase{>2}DetailsOfCase
5	The individual had entered the country two days earlier
6	after spending some weeks in Iran ,
7	which is currently experiencing a sizable outbreak of the disease .
PersonTraveledFromIran{=4}CurrentlyInHospital
8	I can report to the House
9	that they are currently in a stable and improving condition at Auckland Hospital .
DetailsOfIndividual{=3}LimitSpread
10	The good news in this instance is that the individual had limited contact with people upon their return to the country ,
11	and their family took all the appropriate measures
12	when presenting at the emergency department .
13	As you would expect ,
14	our public health service is working hard
15	to contain this first case
16	and limit the risk of any spread of the disease .
17	Contact tracing began immediately
18	and has gone to plan .
19	All 15 people
20	who were seated nearby the individual on their flight into New Zealand
21	have been traced
22	and are being told to self - isolate .
23	Public health staff will remain in touch with individuals
24	to monitor the situation
25	and give ongoing advice .
15PeopleInCloseContact{=5}RemainingPassengers
26	All but 10 of the remaining passengers on the flight ,
27	who are not considered to be close contacts ,
28	have also been contacted
29	to provide reassurance
30	and answer any questions
31	they might have ;
32	those 10
33	that have n't been contacted
34	did not provide accurate contact information .
LimitSpread{<4}DecisiveResponseLowChanceOutbreak
35	I 'm advised
36	that
37	as a result of our decisive response ,
38	the chance of an outbreak from our first case is low .
FirstConfirmedCaseNZ{>1}NZGeneralStepsCovid
39	Internationally , the situation with COVID - 19 continues to develop at pace .
40	However , the Director - General of the World Health Organization said , this morning ,
41	containment â€¦ is feasible
42	and must remain the top priority for all countries .
WHOStatement{<3}NZApproach
43	This is exactly the approach
44	that New Zealand is taking ,
45	using three main tools :
46	border controls ; self - isolation ; and good public health practices ,
47	including highlighting the importance of basic hygiene .
ThreeMainStepsAndHygiene{>5}GovernmentEffortsControlSituation
48	At every step , the Government has taken decisions in the interests of health and safety of the wider public ,
49	and so far we have been among the best
50	at keeping COVID - 19 at bay .
GeneralSteps{=4}TravelRestrictions
51	Just yesterday , Cabinet decided to extend for another week the travel restrictions
52	that have been in place for China since 3 February and for Iran since last Friday .
ExtendTravelRestrictions{>5}RestrictionsSuccessfulKeepCovidOut
53	These restrictions have played a key role
54	in keeping COVID - 19 out of New Zealand for so long
55	and have given us time
56	to better understand the disease
57	and ramp up our preparations .
GeneralApproachAndTravelRestriction{=2}FurtherPrecaution
58	Of course , members will be aware
59	that there are outbreaks in other regions as well .
60	So , as a further precaution , we have decided
61	that anyone arriving in New Zealand
62	who has been in northern Italy or South Korea
63	who has been there in the last 14 days
64	will be registered for self - isolation .
Self-IsolationFromItalyKorea{>5}Reasoning
65	This is based on an expert assessment of risk .
66	It recognises
67	that
68	while there are outbreaks in both countries ,
69	they also have well - developed health systems
70	and the outbreaks are largely located in specific regions .
71	We know
72	self - isolation works .
73	It is a longstanding and successful approach
74	to managing infectious diseases
75	and has proven its worth again in recent weeks .
Self-Isolation{=4}HealthPresenceAtAirports
76	We have also stepped up the health presence at our airports .
IncreaseHealthPresenceAirports{>5}Regulations
77	All airlines flying into New Zealand have been requested to read a health message
78	upon landing ,
79	and all arrivals into New Zealand will receive health information cards alongside the standard customs declaration form .
80	As a result of decisions
81	taken on Friday ,
82	health staff are meeting all direct international flights
83	landing in New Zealand airports from Hong Kong , Japan , South Korea , Singapore , and Thailand .
84	Our border response is further ramping up
85	to have health staff available for all international flights into New Zealand .
FurtherPrecaution{>3}Acknowledgements
86	All these decisions and actions are designed
87	to limit the spread of any sporadic COVID - 19 cases
88	that might arrive in New Zealand .
89	At the same time , our health system continues its preparations in line with our comprehensive pandemic plan .
EffortsToLimitSpread{>4}ThanksAndReassurance
90	I want to thank our DHBs , public health staff , and primary care and health officials for the work
91	they are doing
92	to protect the public .
Thanks{=5}Reassurance
93	I have high confidence in our medical professionals .
94	We have a strong public health system .
95	We continue to work
96	to keep COVID - 19 out ,
97	but we are ready
98	if it arrives in our community .
