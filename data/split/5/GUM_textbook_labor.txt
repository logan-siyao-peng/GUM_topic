1	Why the Division of Labor Increases Production
2	When we divide and subdivide the tasks
3	involved with producing a good or service ,
4	workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output .
MainObservation{>2}ElaborationAndQuestion
5	In his observations of pin factories , Smith noticed
IntroPinFactories{<4}Observations
6	that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day ,
7	but that a small business of 10 workers
8	( some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks
9	involved with pin - making ) ,
10	could make 48,000 pins in a day .
Elaboration{<3}QuestionOfInterest
11	How can a group of workers ,
12	each specializing in certain tasks ,
13	produce so much more than the same number of workers
14	who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves ?
IntroScenarioAndQuestion{=1}ThreeReasonsAndConclusion
15	Smith offered three reasons .
SmithOfferedThreeReasons{<3}Reasons
16	First , specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process
17	where they have an advantage .
18	( In later chapters , we will develop this idea
19	by discussing comparative advantage . )
Specialization{>5}ExplanationAndRecap
20	People have different skills , talents , and interests ,
21	so they will be better at some jobs than at others .
22	The particular advantages may be based on educational choices ,
23	which are in turn shaped by interests and talents .
24	Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors , for instance .
25	For some goods , geography affects specialization .
26	For example , it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota
27	than in Florida ,
28	but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida
29	than in North Dakota .
30	If you live in or near a big city ,
31	it is easier to attract enough customers
32	to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater
33	than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area .
34	Whatever the reason ,
35	if people specialize in the production
36	of what they do best ,
37	they will be more effective
38	than if they produce a combination of things ,
39	some of which they are good at
40	and some of which they are not .
FirstReason{=4}SecondAndThirdReasons
41	Second , workers
42	who specialize in certain tasks
43	often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality .
44	This pattern holds true for many workers ,
45	including assembly line laborers
46	who build cars ,
47	stylists
48	who cut hair ,
49	and doctors
50	who perform heart surgery .
51	In fact , specialized workers often know their jobs well enough
52	to suggest innovative ways
53	to do their work faster and better .
54	A similar pattern often operates within businesses .
55	In many cases , a business
56	that focuses on one or a few products
57	( sometimes called its “ core competency ” )
58	is more successful than firms
59	that try to make a wide range of products .
SecondReason{=5}ThirdReason
60	Third , specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale ,
61	which means that for many goods ,
62	as the level of production increases ,
63	the average cost
64	of producing each individual unit
65	declines .
66	For example ,
67	if a factory produces only 100 cars per year ,
68	each car will be quite expensive to make on average .
69	However ,
70	if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year ,
71	then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers
72	performing specialized tasks ,
73	and the average cost of production per car will be lower .
ThreeReasons{<2}Conclusion
74	The ultimate result of workers
75	who can focus on their preferences and talents ,
76	learn to do their specialized jobs better ,
77	and work in larger organizations
TheThreeFactors{=3}Result
78	is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more
79	than if each person tried to produce all of his or her own goods and services .
80	The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity .
