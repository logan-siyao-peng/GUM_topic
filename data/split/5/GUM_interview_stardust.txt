4	Stardust is a NASA space capsule
5	that collected samples from comet 81P/Wild
6	( also known as " Wild 2 )
7	in deep space
8	and landed back on Earth on January 15 , 2006 .
WhatIsStardust{=3}StardustAtHomeProject
9	It was decided that a collaborative online review process would be used
10	to " discover " the microscopically small samples
11	the capsule collected .
CollaborativeReviewProcess{=4}HumanIntelligenceAndDirectorIntro
12	The project is called Stardust @ home .
13	Unlike distributed computing projects like SETI @ home , Stardust @ home relies entirely on human intelligence .
14	Andrew Westphal is the director of Stardust @ home .

20	Some may not know exactly
21	what Stardust or Stardust @ home is .
22	Can you explain more about it for us ?

QuestionAndPhotoCaption{<3}Response
26	Stardust is a NASA Discovery mission
27	that was launched in 1999 .
28	It is really two missions in one .
29	The primary science goal of the mission was to collect a sample from a known primitive solar - system body , a comet
30	called Wild 2
31	( pronounced " Vilt - two "
32	— the discoverer was German ,
33	I believe ) .
34	This is the first US " sample return " mission since Apollo , and the first ever from beyond the moon .
35	This gives a little context .
StardustDiscoveryMissionContext{=5}SampleReturnUnprecedentedVideo
36	By " sample return " of course I mean a mission
37	that brings back extraterrestrial material .
38	I should have said above
39	that this is the first " solid " sample return mission —
40	Genesis brought back a sample from the Sun almost two years ago ,
41	but Stardust is also bringing back the first solid samples from the local interstellar medium —
42	basically this is a sample of the Galaxy .
43	This is absolutely unprecedented ,
44	and we 're obviously incredibly excited .
45	I should mention parenthetically
46	that there is a fantastic launch video
47	— taken from the POV of the rocket on the JPL Stardust website —
48	highly recommended
49	— best I 've ever seen —
50	all the way from the launch pad , too .
51	Basically interplanetary trajectory .
52	Absolutely great .
53	Is the video available to the public ?
54	Yes
55	[ see below ] .
IntroStardustContext{=4}HowProjectCarriedOut
56	OK , I digress .
57	The first challenge
58	that we have
59	before can do any kind of analysis of these interstellar dust particles
60	is simply to find them .
61	This is a big challenge
62	because they are very small
63	( order of micron in size )
64	and are somewhere
65	( we do n't know where )
66	on a HUGE collector
67	— at least on the scale of the particle size —
68	about a tenth of a square meter .
Challenge{=5}HowProjectCarriedOut
69	So ...
70	We 're right now using an automated microscope
71	that we developed several years ago for nuclear astrophysics work
72	to scan the collector in the Cosmic Dust Lab in Building 31 at Johnson Space Center .
73	This is the ARES group
74	that handles returned samples
75	( Moon Rocks , Genesis chips , Meteorites , and Interplanetary Dust Particles
76	collected by U2 in the stratosphere ) .
77	The microscope collects stacks of digital images of the aerogel collectors in the array .
78	These images are sent to us
79	— we compress them
80	and convert them into a format appropriate for Stardust @ home .
81	Stardust @ home is a highly distributed project
82	using a " Virtual Microscope "
83	that is written in html and javascript
84	and runs on most browsers
85	— no downloads are required .
86	Using the Virtual Microscope
87	volunteers can search over the collector for the tracks of the interstellar dust particles .

ImageCaption{<5}Question
92	How many samples do you anticipate
93	being found during the course of the project ?
ImageCaptionAndQuestion{<4}Response
94	Great question .
95	The short answer is that we do n't know .
96	The long answer is a bit more complicated .
97	Here 's what we know .
98	The Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft carried dust detectors onboard
99	that Eberhard Gruen and his colleagues used
100	to first detect
101	and them measure the flux of interstellar dust particles
102	streaming into the solar system .
103	( This is a kind of " wind " of interstellar dust ,
104	caused by the fact
105	that our solar system is moving with respect to the local interstellar medium . )
106	Markus Landgraf has estimated the number of interstellar dust particles
107	that should have been captured by Stardust during two periods of the " cruise " phase of the interplanetary orbit
108	in which the spacecraft was moving with this wind .
109	He estimated
110	that there should be around 45 particles ,
111	but this number is very uncertain
112	— I would n't be surprised
113	if it is quite different from that .
114	That was the long answer !
AnswerQuestion{>5}UncertaintyOfOutcome
115	One thing
116	that I should say ...
117	is that like all research , the outcome of what we are doing is highly uncertain .
118	There is a wonderful quote
119	attributed to Einstein —
120	" If we knew
121	what we were doing ,
122	it would n't be called " research " ,
123	would it ? "
HowManySamples{=3}SampleSize
124	How big would the samples be ?
Question{<4}Response
125	We expect
126	that the particles will be of order a micron in size .
127	( A millionth of a meter . )
128	When people are searching
129	using the virtual microscope ,
130	they will be looking not for the particles , but for the tracks
131	that the particles make ,
132	which are much larger
133	— several microns in diameter .
SampleSize{=5}NewSite
134	Just yesterday we switched over to a new site
135	which has a demo of the VM
136	( virtual microscope )
137	I invite you to check it out .
138	The tracks in the demo are from submicron carbonyl iron particles
139	that were shot into aerogel
140	using a particle accelerator
141	modified
142	to accelerate dust particles to very high speeds ,
143	to simulate the interstellar dust impacts
144	that we 're looking for .
145	And that 's on the main Stardust @ home website
146	[ see below ] ?
147	Yes .
