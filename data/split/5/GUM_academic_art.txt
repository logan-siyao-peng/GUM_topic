8	Which elements of specific artworks do they focus on ?
9	Do museum labels have an impact on how people look at artworks ?
QuestionsToConsider{<3}ViewingExperienceComplex
10	The viewing experience of art is a complex one ,
11	involving issues of perception , attention , memory , decision - making , affect , and emotion .
ViewingExperienceComplex{<4}RoomToInvestigate
12	Thus , the time
13	it takes
14	and the ways
15	of visually exploring an artwork
16	can inform about its relevance , interestingness , and even its aesthetic appeal .
IntroFocusOnArtExperience{<2}StudyDetails
17	This paper describes a collaborative pilot project
18	focusing on a unique collection of 17th Century Zurbarán paintings .
19	The Jacob cycle at Auckland Castle is the only UK example of a continental collection
20	preserved in situ in purpose - built surroundings .
ZurbaránCollectionBriefIntro{<4}OverviewAndStructure
21	While studies of the psychology of art have focused on individual works and distinctions between representative / non-representative topics ,
22	no work has been completed on the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of devotional themes .
NoSimilarWorkInPast{<5}PaperOverviewAndStructure
23	In this paper , we report upon the novel insights
24	eye - tracking techniques have provided
25	into the unconscious processes
26	of viewing the unique collection of Zurbarán artworks .
27	The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of different written interpretation on the visual exploration of artworks .
28	We will discuss the potential implications of these techniques and our understanding of visual behaviours on museum and gallery practice .
29	The project brings together established research strengths in Spanish art history , experimental psychology , digital humanities , and museum studies
30	to explore ,
31	using eye - tracking techniques ,
32	aesthetic reactions to digital representations of the individual Zurbarán artworks as well as the significance of the collection as a whole .
ProjectOverviewAndStructure{=3}Eye-TrackingBackgroundAndArtData
33	Our experience of art develops from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes ;
34	the beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork .
ExperienceBeginsWithVisualProcesses{<5}Eye-TrackingResearchDetails
35	When regarding an artwork ,
36	a viewer gathers information through a series fixations ,
37	interspersed by rapid movements of the eye
38	called saccades .
39	The direction of saccades is determined by an interaction between the goals of the observer and the physical properties of the different elements of the scene
40	( e.g. colour , texture , brightness etc ) .
41	Importantly , studying eye movements offers an insight
42	that does not depend on the participants ’ beliefs , memories or subjective impressions of the artwork .
43	Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential
44	to transform the ways
45	we understand visual processing in the arts
46	( see for example Brieber 2014 ; Binderman et al. , 2005 )
47	and at the same time offers a direct way
48	of studying several important factors of a museum visit
49	( Filippini Fantoni et al. , 2013 ; Heidenreich & Turano 2011 ; Milekic 2010 ) .
BackgroundOnEye-TrackingResearch{=4}ZurbaránCollectionDetails
50	Zurbarán ’s cycle of Jacob and his Sons has been on display in the Long Room at Auckland Castle for over 250 years .
51	It is the only cycle
52	to be preserved in purpose - built surroundings in the UK ,
53	and one of very few of its kind in the world .
CollectionIntro{=5}AreasUnexplored
54	It has a long history in scholarship
55	( Baron & Beresford 2014 ) ,
56	but many key aspects of its production and significance have not yet been fully understood .
Introduction{<1}DetailedSummaryOfStudy

58	of exploring audience experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of County Durham ,
59	of which the 13 Zurbarán artworks
60	( there are actually only 12 Zurbarán artworks ,
61	the 13th Benjamin , is a copy by Arthur Pond )
62	are a key part of ,
