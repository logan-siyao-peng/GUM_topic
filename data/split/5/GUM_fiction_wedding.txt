IntroductionHeader{<2}Content
7	The Chemical Wedding by Christian Rosencreutz is the way
8	I ’ve decided to present the title of this book .
IntroTitleBook{>5}HowBookIsOftenTitled
9	Most versions in English are called The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz ,
10	which suggests
11	( and most people
12	who ’ve heard of it suppose )
13	that the wedding is Christian ’s .
14	It ’s not ;
15	Christian Rosencreutz is the purported author of a book called The Chemical Wedding .
ChristianRosencreutzRole{=4}RealAuthor
16	The actual author is Johann Valentin Andreae ,
17	whose name did n’t appear on the book originally ,
18	thus ensuring the confusion .
RealAuthorIsAndreae{>5}AuthorCallsItChemicalWedding
19	I ’ll call it herein
20	( as everyone mostly does )
21	simply The Chemical Wedding .
TitleBackground{>3}MoreInfoFromAuthor
22	Though its original readers would have had a certain amount of context for the truly bizarre and surprising events
23	it tells of ,
OriginalReadersHadContext{<5}Author'sSuggestion
24	it ’s possible that The Chemical Wedding is now more enjoyable
25	without knowing that context ,
26	and experiencing the book unmediated .
27	You might therefore wish to start right in on the first page of text
28	that follows
29	and only then return to this introduction .
Author'sSuggestion{>4}Comparison
30	Consider a similar case :
31	a little book
32	published in 1934 by the Surrealist artist Max Ernst
33	called Une Semaine de Bonté .

Introduction{<1}Story
36	The First Day
FirstDayHeader{<3}Story
37	It was just before Easter Sunday , 1
38	and I was sitting at my table .
Setting{<5}PrayersAndReadyToCook
39	I ’d said my prayers ,
40	talking a long time as usual with my Maker
41	and thinking about some of the great mysteries
42	the Father of Lights had revealed to me .
43	Now I was ready to make and to bake
44	– only in my heart , actually –
45	a small , perfect unleavened wafer
46	to eat with my beloved Paschal Lamb .
SittingAtTable{<4}Disturbances
47	All of a sudden a terrible wind blew up , so strong
48	that I thought
49	the hill
50	my little house was built on
51	would be blown apart –
52	but I ’d seen the Devil do things as bad as this before
53	( the Devil had often tried to harm me ) ,
54	so I took heart
55	and went on meditating .
StrongWind{=5}FeltSomething
56	Till I felt somebody touch me on the back .
57	This frightened me
58	so that I did n’t dare turn .
59	I tried to stay as brave and calm
60	as a human being could under the circumstances .
61	I felt
62	my coat tugged at ,
63	and tugged again ,
64	and at last I looked around .
65	A woman stood there , so bright and beautiful , in a sky - colored robe – a heavens covered with
66	1 Christian ’s story begins just before Easter , like Dante ’s Divine Comedy .
67	It can be seen as an allegory of Christ ’s death and resurrection ,
68	though this idea produces some puzzles .
69	The birds sang so beautifully ,
70	the young deer skipped so happily ,
71	that it gladdened my old heart ,
72	and I could n't help singing too ...

73	THE FOURTH DAY
FourthDayHeader{<3}Story
74	I was awake and lying in bed next morning ,
75	looking idly at the wonderful images and inscriptions all around my room ,
76	when suddenly I heard the sound of trumpets ,
77	as if a procession were already underway .
78	My page jumped out of bed
79	as if crazed ,
80	looking more dead than alive ,
81	and you can imagine
82	how I felt
83	when he cried ,
84	“ They 're already being presented to the king ! "
85	I could only groan in frustration and curse my lazy bones .
86	I got dressed ,
87	but my page was quicker
88	than I was
89	and ran out of the chamber
90	to see what was what .
SuddenlyAwakeNextMorning{=5}HadNotOverslept
91	He soon came back
92	and gave me the good news
93	that I actually had n’t overslept ;
94	all
95	I ’d done
96	was miss breakfast :
97	they had n’t wanted to wake an old man
98	who needed his rest .
99	But now I had to get ready
100	to go with him to the lion fountain ,
101	where most of the others were gathered .
FearOverslept{=4}ReliefAndInscription
102	Such a relief !
103	My spirits recovered ,
104	and
105	as soon as I had got into my habit ,
106	I followed him to the garden
107	I have already told about .
108	I found that the lion , in place of his sword , now held a rather large plaque .
109	Examining this ,
110	I could tell
111	that it had been taken from those ancient monuments
112	I ’d seen
113	and put here for some special reason .
114	The inscription on it was fading away ,
115	so I should set it down here
116	as it was then ,
117	and ask my readers to ponder it :
Garden{=5}Inscription
118	Prince Hermes :
119	Now after humankind has suffered so much harm here
120	I flow
121	having by god ’s counsel and with the help of art become a healing balm .
122	Drink from me
123	if you can ;
124	wash ,
125	if you like ;
126	trouble my waters
127	if you dare .
128	Drink , Brethren !
129	Drink
130	and live !
