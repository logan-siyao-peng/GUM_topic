1	Senator Hatfield , Mr. Chief Justice , Mr. President , Vice President Bush , Vice President Mondale , Senator Baker , Speaker O'Neill , Reverend Moomaw , and my fellow citizens :
AddressAudience{<4}IntroInauguration
2	To a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion ,
3	and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence .
CommonOccurrence{=5}DescribeAsTransferOfAuthority
4	The orderly transfer of authority
5	as called for in the Constitution
6	routinely takes place ,
7	as it has for almost two centuries ,
AddressAllIntroduceInauguration{<3}UniquenessInauguration
8	and few of us stop to think
9	how unique we really are .
10	In the eyes of many in the world , this every 4 - year ceremony
11	we accept as normal
12	is nothing less than a miracle .
UniquenessOfUSDemocracy{=2}ThankPresident'sCarryingOnTradition
13	Mr. President , I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did
14	to carry on this tradition .
PresidentEfforts{<4}ShowWorldUSIsUnited
15	By your gracious cooperation in the transition process , you have shown a watching world
16	that we are a united people
17	pledged to maintaining a political system
18	which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other ,
SignificanceInauguration{<3}ThankPresidentMaintainRepublic
19	and I thank you and your people for all your help
20	in maintaining the continuity
21	which is the bulwark of our Republic .
IntroAndCelebrateUSDemocracy{<1}RevitalizeEconomy
22	The business of our nation goes forward .
23	These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions .
24	We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history .
IntroEconomicCrisis{>3}Details
25	It distorts our economic decisions ,
26	penalizes thrift ,
27	and crushes the struggling young and the fixed - income elderly alike .
28	It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people .
CrisisAffectsAll{=5}ImpactsAndUnfairTaxSystem
29	Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment , human misery , and personal indignity .
30	Those
31	who do work
32	are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system
33	which penalizes successful achievement
34	and keeps us from maintaining full productivity .
CrisisHurtingMillions{=4}Deficits
35	But
36	great as our tax burden is ,
37	it has not kept pace with public spending .
PublicSpending{<5}Deficit
38	For decades we have piled deficit upon deficit ,
39	mortgaging our future and our children 's future for the temporary convenience of the present .
40	To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social , cultural , political , and economic upheavals .
41	You and I , as individuals , can ,
42	by borrowing ,
43	live beyond our means ,
44	but for only a limited period of time .
45	Why , then , should we think
46	that collectively , as a nation , we 're not bound by that same limitation ?
IntroEconomicCrisis{=2}PlansToFixEconomy
47	We must act today
48	in order to preserve tomorrow .
49	And let there be no misunderstanding :
50	We are going to begin to act ,
51	beginning today .
DeclareBeginToActToday{>4}AssureCrisisWillGoAway
52	The economic ills
53	we suffer
54	have come upon us over several decades .
55	They will not go away in days , weeks , or months ,
56	but they will go away .
AssureCrisisWillGoAway{<5}AmericansHaveCapacityResolveCrisis
57	They will go away
58	because we as Americans have the capacity now ,
59	as we 've had in the past ,
60	to do whatever needs to be done
61	to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom .
UrgencyToActNow{<3}SolutionsMustBenefitAll
62	In this present crisis , government is not the solution to our problem ;
63	government is the problem .
64	From time to time we 've been tempted to believe
65	that society has become too complex to be managed by self - rule ,
66	that government by an elite group is superior to government for , by , and of the people .
GovernmentIsProblem{>5}RhetoricalQuestionRightToGovern
67	Well ,
68	if no one among us is capable
69	of governing himself ,
70	then who among us has the capacity
71	to govern someone else ?
72	All of us together , in and out of government , must bear the burden .
RoleOfGovernment{<4}EquitableSolutionsAndObjectives
73	The solutions
74	we seek
75	must be equitable ,
76	with no one group singled out
77	to pay a higher price .
78	We hear much of special interest groups .
79	Well , our concern must be for a special interest group
80	that has been too long neglected .
81	It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions ,
82	and it crosses political party lines .
83	It is made up of men and women
84	who raise our food ,
85	patrol our streets ,
86	man our mines and factories ,
87	teach our children ,
88	keep our homes ,
89	and heal us
90	when we 're sick â€”
91	professionals , industrialists , shopkeepers , clerks , cabbies , and truck drivers .
92	They are , in short , " We the people , "
93	this breed
94	called Americans .
EquitableSolutionAmericanPeople{=5}Administration'sObjective
95	Well , this administration 's objective will be a healthy , vigorous , growing economy
96	that provides equal opportunities for all Americans , with no barriers
97	born of bigotry or discrimination .
98	Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work .
99	Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs .
100	All must share in the productive work of this " new beginning , "
101	and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy .
102	With the idealism and fair play
103	which are the core of our system and our strength ,
104	we can have a strong and prosperous America , at peace with itself and the world .
