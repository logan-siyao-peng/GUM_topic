1	2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory
2	By the end of this section , you will be able to :
3	State the postulates of Dalton ’s atomic theory
4	Use postulates of Dalton ’s atomic theory
5	to explain the laws of definite and multiple proportions
6	The earliest recorded discussion of the basic structure of matter comes from ancient Greek philosophers , the scientists of their day .
7	In the fifth century BC , Leucippus and Democritus argued
8	that all matter was composed of small , finite particles
9	that they called atomos ,
10	a term derived from the Greek word for “ indivisible . ”
11	They thought of atoms as moving particles
12	that differed in shape and size ,
13	and which could join together .
AncientGreece{=4}Aristotle
14	Later , Aristotle and others came to the conclusion
15	that matter consisted of various combinations of the four “ elements ”
16	— fire , earth , air , and water —
17	and could be infinitely divided .
EarlyTheories{=3}NeverTestedIdeas
18	Interestingly , these philosophers thought about atoms and “ elements ” as philosophical concepts ,
19	but apparently never considered performing experiments
20	to test their ideas .
Background{<2}Dalton'sAtomicTheory
21	The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years ,
Pre-DaltonViews{<4}IntroDalton
22	until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis
23	that the behavior of matter could be explained
24	using an atomic theory .
25	First published in 1807 ,
26	many of Dalton ’s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory .
IntroDalton{<3}AtomicTheoryPostulatesAndElaboration
27	Here are the postulates of Dalton ’s atomic theory .
28	1. Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles
29	called atoms .
30	An atom is the smallest unit of an element
31	that can participate in a chemical change .
32	2. An element consists of only one type of atom ,
33	which has a mass
34	that is characteristic of the element
35	and is the same for all atoms of that element
36	( Figure 2.2 ) .
37	A macroscopic sample of an element contains an incredibly large number of atoms ,
38	all of which have identical chemical properties .
39	Figure 2.2
40	A pre-1982 copper penny
41	( left )
42	contains approximately 3 ×× 10 22 copper atoms
43	( several dozen are represented as brown spheres at the right ) ,
44	each of which has the same chemical properties .

47	3. Atoms of one element differ in properties from atoms of all other elements .
48	4. A compound consists of atoms of two or more elements
49	combined in a small , whole - number ratio .
50	In a given compound , the numbers of atoms of each of its elements are always present in the same ratio
51	( Figure 2.3 ) .
52	Figure 2.3
53	Copper(II) oxide , a powdery , black compound , results from the combination of two types of atoms
54	— copper
55	( brown spheres )
56	and oxygen
57	( red spheres ) —
58	in a 1 : 1 ratio .

61	5. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change ,
62	but are instead rearranged to yield substances
63	that are different from those
64	present before the change
65	( Figure 2.4 ) .
66	Figure 2.4
67	When the elements copper
68	( a shiny , red - brown solid ,
69	shown here as brown spheres )
70	and oxygen
71	( a clear and colorless gas ,
72	shown here as red spheres )
73	react ,
74	their atoms rearrange
75	to form a compound
76	containing copper and oxygen
77	( a powdery , black solid ) .

AtomicTheoryPostulates{=4}ConnectionToMacroscopicProperties
80	Dalton ’s atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter
81	that you ’ve learned about .
82	For example ,
83	if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom ,
84	then it can not be broken down into simpler substances ,
85	that is , into substances
86	composed of fewer types of atoms .
87	And
88	if atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change ,
89	then the total mass of matter present
90	when matter changes from one type to another
91	will remain constant
92	( the law of conservation of matter ) .

FirstQuestionTitle{<4}Question
95	In the following drawing , the green spheres represent atoms of a certain element .
96	The purple spheres represent atoms of another element .
97	If the spheres touch ,
98	they are part of a single unit of a compound .
99	Does the following chemical change
100	represented by these symbols
101	violate any of the ideas of Dalton ’s atomic theory ?
102	If so ,
103	which one ?
104	Solution
105	The starting materials consist of two green spheres and two purple spheres .
106	The products consist of only one green sphere and one purple sphere .
107	This violates Dalton ’s postulate
108	that atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change ,
109	but are merely redistributed .
110	( In this case , atoms appear to have been destroyed . )

117	represented by these symbols
118	violate any of the ideas of Dalton ’s atomic theory ?
119	If so ,

121	ANSWER :
122	The starting materials consist of four green spheres and two purple spheres .
123	The products consist of four green spheres and two purple spheres .
124	This does not violate any of Dalton ’s postulates :
125	Atoms are neither created
126	nor destroyed ,
127	but are redistributed in small , whole - number ratios .
