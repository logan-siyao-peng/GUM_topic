FigureCredit{<3}Introduction
11	Some scholars believe
12	that between nine and fifteen thousand years ago , a land bridge existed between Asia and North America
13	that we now call Beringia .
14	The first inhabitants of what would be named the Americas migrated across this bridge in search of food .
15	When the glaciers melted ,
16	water engulfed Beringia ,
17	and the Bering Strait was formed .
18	Later settlers came by boat across the narrow strait .
19	( The fact
20	that Asians and American Indians share genetic markers on a Y chromosome
21	lends credibility to this migration theory . )
Migration{=4}SettlementAndAgriculture
22	Continually moving southward ,
23	the settlers eventually populated both North and South America ,
24	creating unique cultures
25	that ranged from the highly complex and urban Aztec civilization in what is now Mexico City to the woodland tribes of eastern North America .
26	Recent research along the west coast of South America suggests
27	that migrant populations may have traveled down this coast by water as well as by land .
28	Researchers believe
29	that about ten thousand years ago , humans also began the domestication of plants and animals ,
30	adding agriculture as a means of sustenance to hunting and gathering techniques .
31	With this agricultural revolution , and the more abundant and reliable food supplies
32	it brought ,
33	populations grew
34	and people were able to develop a more settled way of life ,
35	building permanent settlements .
36	Nowhere in the Americas was this more obvious than in Mesoamerica
37	( Figure 1.3 ) .
38	Figure 1.3
39	This map shows the extent of the major civilizations of the Western Hemisphere .
40	In South America , early civilizations developed along the coast
41	because the high Andes and the inhospitable Amazon Basin made the interior of the continent less favorable for settlement .

43	THE OLMEC
44	Mesoamerica is the geographic area
45	stretching from north of Panama up to the desert of central Mexico .
46	Although marked by great topographic , linguistic , and cultural diversity ,
47	this region cradled a number of civilizations with similar characteristics .
48	Mesoamericans were polytheistic ;
49	their gods possessed both male and female traits
50	and demanded blood sacrifices of enemies
51	taken in battle
52	or ritual bloodletting .
53	Corn , or maize ,
54	domesticated by 5000 BCE ,
55	formed the basis of their diet .
56	They developed a mathematical system ,
57	built huge edifices ,
58	and devised a calendar
59	that accurately predicted eclipses and solstices
60	and that priest - astronomers used
61	to direct the planting and harvesting of crops .
62	Most important for our knowledge of these peoples ,
63	they created the only known written language in the Western Hemisphere ;
64	researchers have made much progress
65	in interpreting the inscriptions on their temples and pyramids .
66	Though the area had no overarching political structure ,
67	trade over long distances helped diffuse culture .
68	Weapons
69	made of obsidian ,
70	jewelry
71	crafted from jade ,
72	feathers
73	woven into clothing and ornaments ,
74	and cacao beans
75	that were whipped into a chocolate drink
76	formed the basis of commerce .
77	The mother of Mesoamerican cultures was the Olmec civilization .
78	Flourishing along the hot Gulf Coast of Mexico from about 1200 to about 400 BCE ,
79	the Olmec produced a number of major works of art , architecture , pottery , and sculpture .
80	Most recognizable are their giant head sculptures
81	( Figure 1.4 )
82	and the pyramid in La Venta .
83	The Olmec built aqueducts
84	to transport water into their cities
85	and irrigate their fields .
86	They grew maize , squash , beans , and tomatoes .
87	They also bred small domesticated dogs
88	which , along with fish , provided their protein .
89	Although no one knows
90	what happened to the Olmec after about 400 BCE ,
91	in part because the jungle reclaimed many of their cities ,
92	their culture was the base
93	upon which the Maya and the Aztec built .
94	It was the Olmec
95	who worshipped a rain god , a maize god , and the feathered serpent so important in the future pantheons of the Aztecs
96	( who called him Quetzalcoatl )
97	and the Maya
98	( to whom he was Kukulkan ) .
99	The Olmec also developed a system of trade throughout Mesoamerica ,
100	giving rise to an elite class .
101	Figure 1.4
102	The Olmec carved heads from giant boulders
103	that ranged from four to eleven feet in height
104	and could weigh up to fifty tons .
105	All these figures have flat noses , slightly crossed eyes , and large lips .
106	These physical features can be seen today in some of the peoples indigenous to the area .
TheOlmec{=4}TheMaya
107	THE MAYA
108	After the decline of the Olmec , a city rose in the fertile central highlands of Mesoamerica .
109	One of the largest population centers in pre-Columbian America and home to more than 100,000 people at its height in about 500 CE ,
110	Teotihuacan was located about thirty miles northeast of modern Mexico City .
111	The ethnicity of this settlement ’s inhabitants is debated ;
112	some scholars believe
113	it was a multiethnic city .
114	Large - scale agriculture and the resultant abundance of food allowed time
115	for people to develop special trades and skills other than farming .
116	Builders constructed over twenty - two hundred apartment compounds for multiple families , as well as more than a hundred temples .
117	Among these were the Pyramid of the Sun
118	( which is two hundred feet high )
119	and the Pyramid of the Moon
120	( one hundred and fifty feet high ) .
121	Near the Temple of the Feathered Serpent , graves have been uncovered
122	that suggest
123	humans were sacrificed for religious purposes .
124	The city was also the center for trade ,
125	which extended to settlements on Mesoamerica ’s Gulf Coast .
126	The Maya were one Mesoamerican culture
127	that had strong ties to Teotihuacan .
128	The Maya ’s architectural and mathematical contributions were significant .
129	Flourishing from roughly 2000 BCE to 900 CE in what is now Mexico , Belize , Honduras , and Guatemala ,
130	the Maya perfected the calendar and written language
131	the Olmec had begun .
132	They devised a written mathematical system
133	to record crop yields and the size of the population ,
134	and to assist in trade .
135	Surrounded by farms
136	relying on primitive agriculture ,
137	they built the city - states of Copan , Tikal , and Chichen Itza along their major trade routes , as well as temples , statues of gods , pyramids , and astronomical observatories
138	( Figure 1.5 ) .
139	However ,
140	because of poor soil and a drought
141	that lasted nearly two centuries ,
142	their civilization declined by about 900 CE
143	and they abandoned their large population centers .
144	Figure 1.5
145	El Castillo ,
146	located at Chichen Itza in the eastern Yucatán peninsula ,
147	served as a temple for the god Kukulkan .
148	Each side contains ninety - one steps to the top .
149	When counting the top platform ,
150	the total number of stairs is three hundred and sixty - five , the number of days in a year .

153	The Spanish found little organized resistance among the weakened Maya upon their arrival in the 1520s .
154	However , they did find Mayan history , in the form of glyphs , or pictures
155	representing words ,
156	recorded in folding books
157	called codices
158	( the singular is codex ) .
159	In 1562 , Bishop Diego de Landa ,
160	who feared
161	the converted natives had reverted to their traditional religious practices ,
162	collected and burned every codex
163	he could find .
164	Today only a few survive .
