LipstickCentral{<3}LipstickContainer

Target{<4}LipstickContainer
6	I actually want to get one of those acrylic things
7	where the lipsticks can just stand up in it
8	and it looks super neat .
9	Like that 's definitely what I want .
LipstickContainer{<2}SpringCleaningPurpose
10	But I also need to clear a lot of these out
11	because I know
12	a lot of these lipsticks are at least over like two three years old
13	and that 's like not okay .
IntroLipStick{<1}LipstickSpringCleaning
14	Alright so let 's have a quick look at this .
15	My fancy lipsticks — I ca n't part with them yet .
16	I just I literally ca n't

FancyLipsticks{=4}PatMcGrathLipstick
18	Let 's see .
19	Okay so this is a Pat McGrath lipstick .
20	Oh my gosh .
21	It 's like the most beautiful red lipstick .
22	Look at this .
23	Let me swatch it for you real quick , real quick .
24	Mm !
25	Look at how beautiful this is .
26	I feel like I do n't want to throw it away .
FancyLipstick{=3}ExpirationInfoAndKeep
27	But anyways , so on the bottom of this lipstick you can see where it says eighteen months is the shelf life so .
28	Let me see if I can —
29	Can you all see this ?
30	I will definitely insert a little clip here
31	that will show you what the shelf life symbol looks like on products .
32	So you will find this on all your cosmetics , your makeup .
33	It is usually on there .
34	So
35	when it says eighteen M
36	that means that product , after eighteen months , is expired .
Explanation{>4}Keeps
37	I feel like this is not too far past eighteen months ,
38	and I mean look at the red .
39	It 's beautiful ,
40	so I ca n't part with it .
41	This is a problem .
FancyLipstickAndExpirationInfo{=2}MoreSortingAndDoorbell
42	Oh my gosh .
43	The doorbell rang .
44	Excitement !
45	Who 's at the door Hershey ?
46	Ah !

52	You 're gon na spring clean with me ?

54	Yes you are !
55	Look at her .
56	Guys I love her so much !
57	Hershey it 's your first vlog .

59	Ah !
Doorbell{<3}MoreSorting
60	Alright .
61	Let 's get into this .
62	See what else we got here .
63	Okay Too Faced Melted Matte Liquid Lipstick .
64	I also love this .
65	I love this color .
66	See what this says .
67	This says twelve months .
68	One hundred percent this is definitely definitely expired ,
69	but it 's just with lipsticks it 's kind of hard to tell .
70	Like — like usually with foundations
71	when it 's expired ,
72	you will see the oil separating and all that ,
73	but this just looks —
74	it looks fine .
75	Makes it hard to throw away ,
76	but I 'm gon na create like a little expired pile down here on the floor .
TooFacedAndExpiredPile{=4}MoreSorting
77	Alright what is this ?
78	Oh this is Ofra !
79	Oh my god
80	I had this back in college
81	is when I ordered this ,
82	which is probably around twenty sixteen .
83	This is four years old .
84	Everything has like rubbed off of it .
85	This has one thousand percent got to go in the throw away pile .
86	Oh it looks kind of dry and crusty too .
87	Yeah no .
88	Not a good look .
89	Let 's throw this out .
90	Go ahead
91	and comment below .
92	How many of you people actually knew
93	that makeup expires ?
94	Cuz I actually did not know
95	and actually did n't realize
96	what that symbol meant
97	until I heard other people talking about it
98	and I was like
99	wait what ? .
100	Next up we got Ashton Liquid Lipstick by Anastasia Beverly Hills .
101	Six months !
102	You 're supposed to finish a whole liquid lipstick in six months .
103	That is wild .
104	I definitely had this for at least — at least four years
105	cuz I definitely had this in college as well .
106	Yeah that 's gon na have to go in the expired pile .
107	So Dose of Colors definitely does not have an expiration date on their products .
108	I do n't know
109	if this means
110	that they just do n't expire
111	or I do n't know .
112	I do n't know
113	what that means .
114	Okay .
115	Let 's keep going .
116	I 'm a just put all the Dose of Color in a separate pile
117	cuz that 's kind of weird .
118	I might need to research that a little bit .
119	Oh !
120	Okay .
121	Let me show you guys .
122	That is an expired lipstick .
123	Ew .
124	Okay so the fancy lipsticks have a shelf life of twelve months ,
125	so one full year .
126	I know
127	I 've definitely had this over a year though .
128	I think .
129	Have I had this over a year ?
130	My gosh it 's hard to think back .
131	But yeah this just does not look good .
132	That 's gon na have to go in the expired pile .
133	Yikes !
134	This black is also not looking good .
135	I feel like I 've only had the black since last year Halloween though .
136	Or was it the Halloween before ?
137	Guys this is harder
138	than I thought .
139	I ca n't remember
140	when I bought things .
141	It 's not looking good though .
142	It 's all like super separated .
143	I do n't like how that looks .
144	Expired !
145	Oh so this is interesting .
146	Black Up actually has twenty four months of shelf life for their lip pencils
147	which is really really good .
148	That 's two years .
149	But is that actually good ?
150	Does that mean
151	that this is chocked full of preservatives ?
152	That 's like not healthy for you ?
153	I do n't know !
154	But I 've definitely had this for more than two years .
155	Expired .
156	This blue lipstick is definitely old .
157	Definitely old .
158	I do n't know
159	if you can actually tell
160	by looking at it
161	but she 's old .
162	Let 's see what the shelf life is .
163	That 's interesting .
164	The Urban Decay does not have a shelf life on the actual stick .
165	So you know
166	how lipsticks usually come in packaging ?
167	It usually comes in that little box ?
168	I 'm thinking
169	that maybe Dose of Colors and Urban Decay have the shelf life
170	printed on those boxes
171	but who keeps their lipsticks in a box ?
172	Like how do I know now
173	if this is expired or not ?
174	I 've definitely had this over two years though
175	so I 'm just gon na go ahead
176	and throw it in the expired pile .
177	I feel like two years is kind of the limit
178	that I 've seen so far .
179	This has a shelf life of six months !
180	Expired .
181	So this is the throw out slash expired pile .
182	This is the I do n't know what to do with it pile ,
183	but I think
184	these are all the Dose of Colors lipsticks
185	that I know
186	I 've had for at least over two years .
