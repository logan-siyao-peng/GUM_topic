6	to develop its sport media and communication research and teaching contents .

Intro{<1}Interview
10	Why do you think
11	the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US
12	compared to other countries like Australia , the United Kingdom and even Canada ?
Question{<3}Response
13	Sports in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society .
14	It emphasizes consumerism , the belief
15	that success always goes to people
16	who merit it due to their abilities , dedication and qualifications ,
17	and reinforces ,
18	rather than changes ,
19	existing ideas
20	related to gender , ethnicity and nationality .
ReaffirmExistingPowerRelations{<4}ParalympicsGoesAgainstThat
21	Paralympic sport brings attention to athletes
22	who are typically overlooked in American society
23	because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people
24	who are disabled .
25	Although disability is not contagious ,
26	interest in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males
27	following it .
28	Disabled athletes also challenge existing relations of power
29	by displaying dedication , hard work and perseverance in different contexts
30	than those most sports fans are accustomed to .

31	Other countries ,
32	including the ones
33	you mention ,
34	have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society .
35	Even though legislative support may be less strong
36	than the one
37	provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act ,
38	many social institutions
39	including the media
40	are more receptive to this form of diversity .
QuestionBackground{<4}Question
41	What do you think
42	the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be
43	with the Games being televised live in the United States for first time ?
Question{<3}Response
44	The impact depends on a number of aspects .
MultipleAspects{<4}Factors
45	One of them is the channels
46	that NBC as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use
47	to air the Paralympic Games on .
48	Will they be shown nationally or regionally , on NBC or on any of the company ’s multiple cable networks ?
49	A second aspect is the parts or hours of the day
50	the Paralympics will be shown .
51	Remember
52	that there is a nine - hour difference between Sochi and New York , and a 12 - hour difference between Sochi and the US West Coast .
53	So daytime events will be shown live in the United States in the middle of the night ,
54	and evening prime - time events will be shown
55	— indeed live —
56	in the morning U.S. time .
57	So showing the Paralympics live on United States television might turn out to be less glamorous
58	than it appears .
59	A third important factor is the way
60	the event will be mediated :
61	will NBC have its best sports broadcasters
62	following the event
63	after having worked the Winter Olympics ?
64	Will they treat and announce the competitions
65	as they do all others
66	— for better and worse ?
67	Will they take it as an opportunity
68	to educate viewers about disability and diversity
69	while showing superb athletic performances
70	without engaging in a discourse of pity ?
71	All in all , I think
72	this is a terrific opportunity
73	to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects ;
74	but we will have to wait until after the event
75	to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations .
