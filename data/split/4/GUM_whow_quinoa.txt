MethodOneHeader{<4}Steps
21	Rinse the grains of quinoa in water .
22	You can skip this step
23	if you have purchased pre-rinsed quinoa in a box .
24	To rinse ,
25	place the measured grain in a strainer under running water for a few minutes .
26	This is necessary
27	to remove the excess saponins on the outside of the grains
28	which impart a bitter flavor to quinoa
29	if not removed .
30	Toast quinoa in a saucepan
31	( optional ) .
32	Drizzle a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium - high heat .
33	Add the quinoa
34	and cook for about 1 minute .

36	Cook the quinoa .
37	Place two parts water or stock to one part of quinoa in a saucepan over medium - high heat
38	and bring to a boil .
39	Cover
40	and reduce heat to low .
41	Simmer the quinoa for about 15 minutes
42	or until the grain becomes translucent
43	and the white germ forms a visible spiral on the exterior of the quinoa grain .
44	Try to ensure there is an al dente bite to the germ , in the same way as pasta .
45	Quinoa will continue cooking for a bit
46	even after you take it off the heat .
47	Take the quinoa off the heat
48	and let stand ,
49	covered ,
50	for 5 minutes .
51	This will give it time
52	to absorb any moisture
53	that might still be in the pan .
54	Uncover
55	and fluff with a fork .
56	The quinoa should look light and fluffy ,
57	and you should be able to see the germ
58	separating from the seed .
59	Serve .
60	Freshly cooked quinoa should be served immediately
61	to retain nutritional value and a good flavor .
62	Serve with :
63	Stir - fry ,
64	using the quinoa as a substitute for rice .
65	Curry .
66	Braised meat .
67	In a salad .
