3	Rachel Rook took Carroll home
4	to meet her parents

GistOfPlot{>3}RachelVeryPrivate
6	For a generous girl , a girl
7	who took off her clothes with abandon ,
8	she was remarkably close - mouthed about some things .
ReservedInSomeWays{<4}Rachel'sParents
9	In two months Carroll had learned
10	that her parents lived on a farm several miles outside of town ;
11	that they sold strawberries in summer ,
12	and Christmas trees in the winter .
13	He knew
14	that they never left the farm ;
15	instead , the world came to them in the shape of weekend picnickers and driveby tourists .
Intro{=2}Dialogue
16	Do you think your parents will like me ? "
17	he said .
18	He had spent the afternoon preparing for this visit as carefully
19	as if he were preparing for an exam .
20	He had gotten his hair cut ,
21	trimmed his nails ,
22	washed his neck and behind his ears .
23	The outfit
24	he had chosen ,
25	khaki pants and a blue button - down shirt
26	-- no tie --
27	lay neatly folded on the bed .
28	He stood before Rachel in his plain white underwear and white socks ,
29	gazing at her
30	as if she were a mirror .
CarrollQuestion{=4}RachelResponse
31	" No , "
32	she said .
33	It was the first time
34	she had been to his apartment ,
35	and she stood square in the center of his bedroom ,
36	her arms folded against her body
37	as if she was afraid to sit down , to touch something .
InitialExchangeAndDescription{>3}Dialogue
38	" Why ? "
39	" My father will like you , "
40	she said .
41	" But he likes everyone .
42	My mother 's more particular --
43	she thinks
44	that you lack a serious nature . "
45	Carroll put on his pants ,
46	admiring the crease .
47	" So you 've talked to her about me . "
48	" Yes . "
49	" But you have n't talked about her to me . "
50	" No . "
51	" Are you ashamed of her ? "
52	Rachel snorted .
Rachel'sParents{=4}RachelRegret
53	Then she sighed in a way
54	that seemed to suggest
55	she was regretting her decision
56	to take him home .
57	" You 're ashamed of me , "
58	he guessed ,
59	and Rachel kissed him
60	and smiled
61	and did n't say anything .
62	Rachel still lived on her parents ' farm ,
63	which made it all the more remarkable that she had kept Carroll and her parents apart for so long .
64	It suggested a talent for daily organization
65	that filled Carroll 's heart with admiration and lust .
Present{=1}FlashbackWhenTheyFirstMet
66	She was nineteen , two years younger than Carroll ;
67	she was a student at Jellicoh College
68	and every weekday she rose at seven
69	and biked four miles into town ,
70	and then back again on her bike , four miles uphill to the farm .

71	Carroll met Rachel in the Jellicoh College library ,
72	where he had a part - time job .
73	He sat at the checkout desk ,
74	stamping books and reading Tristram Shandy for a graduate class ;

75	he was almost asleep

WhatCarrollWasDoing{<3}MeetingRachel
78	He looked up .
79	The girl
80	who stood before the tall desk
81	was red - headed .
82	Sunlight
83	streaming in through a high window opposite her
84	lit up the fine hairs on her arm , the embroidered flowers on the collar of her white shirt .
85	The sunlight turned her hair to fire
86	and Carroll found it difficult to look directly at her .
DescriptionOfRachel{<4}Dialogue
87	" Can I help you ? "
88	he said .
89	She placed a shredded rectangle on the desk ,
90	and Carroll picked it up between his thumb and forefinger .
91	Pages hung in tatters from the sodden blue spine .
92	Title , binding , and covers had been gnawed away .
93	" I need to pay for a damaged book , "
94	she said .
95	" What happened ?
96	Did your dog eat it ? "
97	he said ,
98	making a joke .
99	" Yes , "
100	she said ,
101	and smiled .
102	" What 's your name ? "
103	Carroll said .
104	Already , he thought
105	he might be in love .
