32	[ a ]

43	Dvořák 's first piece of a religious nature , his setting of Stabat Mater , was premiered in Prague in 1880 .
44	It was very successfully performed in London in 1883 ,
45	leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States .

47	In his career , Dvořák made nine invited visits to England ,
48	often conducting performances of his own works .
49	His Seventh Symphony was written for London .
50	Visiting Russia in March 1890 ,
51	he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg .

62	and his Cello Concerto , one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti .
63	He also wrote his most appreciated piece of chamber music , the American String Quartet , during this time .
64	But shortfalls in payment of his salary , along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness , led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895 .
65	All of Dvořák 's nine operas but his first have librettos in Czech
66	and were intended to convey Czech national spirit ,
67	as were some of his choral works .
