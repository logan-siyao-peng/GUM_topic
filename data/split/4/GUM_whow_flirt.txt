8	to start flirting smartly and respectfully .
Intro{<1}Do'sAndDon't's

11	Start the conversation casually .
12	As in the real world , the first step
13	to flirting
14	is to get over your cold feet
15	and jump right in !
16	Text the other person a brief message
17	asking them about their day ,
18	asking them a specific question about work or school ,
19	or simply saying " Hi ! " .
20	The hardest part of flirting is to break through your initial reluctance ,
21	so
22	if you 're having a hard time
23	taking the plunge
24	, just remind yourself that no matter how badly it goes ,
25	it 'll be less stressful than an equivalent real - world encounter .
26	There 's no reason
27	to be nervous
28	when it comes to IM flirting —
29	if the person
30	you want to talk to
31	does n't want to talk to you ,
32	s/he always has the option
33	of simply not responding to your message ,
34	as , from your point of view , this is indistinguishable from him or her simply being away from the computer .
35	This being said ,
36	if you barely know someone ,
37	it can be a good idea to have an excuse
38	for starting a conversation
39	to avoid awkwardness .
40	Asking for help with a work or school - related problem is almost always a good bet ,
41	as is asking a question about something striking about the person .
42	For instance ,
43	if the person has a band - related username
44	, you might say :
45	" Hey , cool name .
46	Did you see those guys
47	when they last came to town ? "
GettingStarted{=4}ConvoContent
48	Start small talk .
49	After your initial greeting and exchange of pleasantries , you 'll probably want to ask how the person 's doing
50	( just like you might in the real world ) .
51	Ask him or her about work or school , his / her interests , or any recent trips , for instance .
52	Rather than asking a question ,
53	you can also simply offer your comments on these things .
54	When s/he responds ,
55	add your own comments
56	or ask follow - up questions
57	and proceed from there !
58	Do n't pry into his or her personal life —
59	keep things light , fun , and focused on worry - free subjects .
60	Do n't dwell too long on small talk .
61	A minute or two is great
62	for breaking the ice ,
63	but much more can get boring fast .
64	For example ,
65	after we 've opened up
66	by asking about this person 's interest in the band in his / her username ,
67	it 's logical and reasonable to ask about this person 's musical likes and dislikes .
68	You can even offer your own opinions and suggestions .
69	For instance , you might say something like :
70	" If you like those guys ,
71	you might want to check out this band
72	called Manic Albatross -
73	they 're like the Beatles , only darker .
74	What sorts of other bands do you like ? "
75	Joke .
76	Everyone likes a good sense of humor .
77	In the immortal words of Marilyn Monroe ,
78	" If you can make a woman laugh ,
79	you can make her do anything "
80	( do n't worry , ladies —
81	the same is true for men ! )
82	Try to be playful and even slightly sarcastic
83	as you respond to the statements of the person
84	you 're talking to .
85	For instance ,
86	if you 're asked what you 're up to ,
87	rather than saying , " looking for people to hit on on Facebook "
88	you might find that it 's a better idea to give a sarcastic answer like " writing the great American novel " or " drowning my sorrows " .
89	These responses have the added benefit of being natural launching points for conversations about your hobbies , like the writing
90	you 're doing on the side
91	and the great bourbon
92	you tasted the other day .
93	In our example conversation , you might work a joke or two into your music - related small talk .
94	For instance , you might say something like ,
95	" I do n't know
96	why every song on the radio nowadays has a Texas Flynn feature .
97	Does he even have time
98	to record
99	between rehab stints ? "
Do's{=2}Dont's
100	Part 2 of 2 :
101	Flirting Don'ts
Part2Don'tsHeader{<3}Content
102	Do n't be too self - deprecating .
103	Simply put , confidence is sexy .
104	This is more true for real - life situations
105	than it is online ,
106	but this mantra has some truth in the world of IM flirting as well .
107	For instance , you 'll want to avoid making lots of jokes at your own expense .
108	Just one is plenty —
109	it should n't be a recurring theme throughout your conversation .
110	Doing this too often can quickly turn an otherwise flirtatious conversation into one
111	in which you appear needy and self - loathing .
112	On the other hand , this is n't to say that you should necessarily make jokes at other people 's expense ,
113	as this can make you seem mean and petty .
114	Any sort of pointed or caustic remarks about yourself or someone else do n't have a place in flirtatious conversations .
Don'tBeTooSelf-Deprecating{=4}Don'tBeTooSappy
115	Do n't be too sappy .
116	People like flirting to be fun .
117	For most people , receiving compliments is only fun up to a point —
118	getting more than one or two can make someone feel embarrassed and self - conscious .
119	It can also make him or her question your motives ,
120	leading the person to believe
121	that you may be trying to get something out of him or her .
122	Besides , the wooing power of flowery , gushing compliments is diminished
123	( to say the least )
124	when the compliments are displayed in a tiny box at the bottom of the screen alongside cartoon smiley faces .
125	Instead of relying too heavily on compliments ,
126	instead , focus on having an engaging , genuine conversation .
127	Follow the mantra " show , do n't tell . "
128	In other words , show that you 're attracted to this person
129	by giving him or her a great conversation ,
130	not by stating it outright .
